<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you keep interrupting your evening to check and respond to e-mail, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an approaching deadline, you’re robbing your directed attention centres of the uninterrupted rest they need for restoration. Even if these work dashes consume only a small amount of time, they prevent you from reaching the levels of deeper relaxation in which attention restoration can occur. Only the confidence that you’re done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow. </p>

<h2 id="learnings-">Learnings:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduce noise from things that do not align to your goal</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find places to work in complete isolation. These are places where it is hard for people to interrupt you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Schedule your week. By creating periods of time for work or planning or communication you get a better sense of how you spend your time and will be more proactive in spending your time wisely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Real time communication and social media are a plague on our ability to focus on ourselves and our goals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write emails / messages in a way in which the intent is clear, this saves time for both parties as it reduces the amount of emails sent (amount of distractions). For example do not ask “Do you want to catch a coffee sometime next week” but instead ask “Are you free to have coffee with me on Wednesday at 4pm? If so reply to this email and I will send you a calendar invite. If not have a great day :)”</p>
