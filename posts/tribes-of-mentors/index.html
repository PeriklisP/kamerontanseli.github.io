<h2 id="is-that-a-dream-or-a-goal-">Is that a dream or a goal?</h2>
<p>A dream is something you fantasise about that will probably never happen.</p>
<p>A goal is something you set a plan for, work towards, and achieve.</p>
<p>The people whom were successful, were people who had structured goals and then put a plan in places to get to those things.</p>
<h2 id="worrying-about-it-now-isn-t-going-to-change-a-damn-thing">Worrying about it now isn&#39;t going to change a damn thing</h2>
<p>Whatever&#39;s going to happen is gonna happen. I&#39;ve either done everything I can to be ready for this, or I haven&#39;t.</p>
<p>My work isn&#39;t done tonight. My work was done 3 months ago, and I just have to show up.</p>
<h2 id="criticising-people">Criticising people</h2>
<p>You should never publicly criticise anyone or anything unless it is a matter of morals or ethics.</p>
<p>Anything you say could at the least ruin someone&#39;s day, or worse, break someone else&#39;s heart, or simply change someone from being a future ally of yours to someone who will never forget that you were unkind or unfairly critical.</p>
<h2 id="when-you-wake-up">When you wake up</h2>
<p><strong>Make your bed</strong>. It is the first task of the day. It will give you pride and encourage you to tackle more tasks throughout the day. It will reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter.</p>
<p><strong>Meditate for 10-20 minutes</strong>. Once you are done have tea or coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Do 5-10 reps of Something</strong>. Enable your state of prime by doing a small bit of exercise in the morning. Try doing push-ups or sit-ups etc.</p>
<p><strong>Journal for 5-10 minutes</strong>. This will clear your mind and leave you with a sense of gratitude. Try writing down 3 things that you&#39;re grateful for.</p>
<h2 id="show-up">Show up</h2>
<p>Dealing with temporary frustration of not making progress is an integral part of the path towards excellence.</p>
<p>Impatience with dealing with frustration is the primary reason that most people fail to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Achieving the extraordinary is not a linear process.</p>
<p><strong>The secret is to show up, do the work and go home</strong>. Nothing should sway you from your purpose. Once the decision has been made, simply refuse to budge. Refuse to compromise.</p>
<p>If you are not encountering defeats on a fairly regular basis, then you are not working hard enough.</p>
<p>Commit to a long term goal then to a series of short term goals. Then only one decision needs to be made and adhered to.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-fetishise-failure">Don&#39;t fetishise failure</h2>
<p>Call me old fashioned but back in the early days of business there was no such thing as a &quot;pivot&quot;. We just called it a fuck-up.</p>
<p>We see companies that, literally, every time we meet them, they&#39;ve pivoted. They never converge on anything because they&#39;re never going to put the time into actually figuring it out and getting it right</p>
<h2 id="build-a-team-that-challenges-you">Build a team that challenges you</h2>
<p>Each partner has the ability to pull the trigger on a deal without a vote or without consensus.</p>
<p>If the person closest to the deal has a very strong degree of positive commitment and enthusiasm about it, then we should do that investment, even if everybody else in the room disagrees.</p>
<p>We formally create the countervailing force to argue the other side. Whenever a partner brings a deal we will just beat the crap out of it. Even if I think its the best idea I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>If they&#39;re still pounding on the table saying, &quot;No, no this is the thing&quot;... Then we say we&#39;re all in.</p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s a disagree and commit culture</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="fall-forward">Fall forward</h2>
<p>We do not stop. We do not slow down. We don&#39;t revisit past decisions. We do not second guess.</p>
<h2 id="being-loosely-held">Being loosely held</h2>
<p>You need to adapt in the light of new information.</p>
<h2 id="they-re-just-like-you">They&#39;re just like you</h2>
<p><em>Life can be so much broader, once you discover that everything around you that you call &#39;life&#39; was made by people that were no smarter than you. You can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you&#39;ll never be the same again.</em> - Steve Jobs</p>
<h2 id="short-and-sweet">Short and Sweet</h2>
<p>To do the original work: It&#39;s not necessary to know something nobody else knows. <strong>It is necessary to believe something few other people believe</strong>.</p>
<p>For every metric, there should be another &#39;paired&#39; metric that addresses adverse consequences of the first metric.</p>
<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
<p>I am a big believer that if you have a clear vision of where you want to go, the rest of it is much easier.</p>
<p>You know why you&#39;re going through this struggle. You have to struggle more and be more disciplined.</p>
<h2 id="just-do-it">Just do it</h2>
<p>It&#39;s not about what you know, it&#39;s about what you do consistently.</p>
<h2 id="business-models-can-be-simple">Business models can be simple</h2>
<p>Add a little buffer so you can give potential customers discounts when getting started with your business.</p>
<p>Look at existing ancient industries and ask how they did it</p>
<h2 id="if-it-is-not-a-hell-yeah-it-s-a-no-">If it is not a &quot;Hell yeah&quot;, it&#39;s a &quot;No&quot;.</h2>
<p>Saying yes to too many things can clutter our lives with mediocre things. Leave your life open to the &quot;Hell yeah&quot; things.</p>
<h2 id="pretend">Pretend</h2>
<p>We are what we pretend to be.</p>
<h2 id="take-the-time-to-be-goofy">Take the time to be goofy</h2>
<p>Know that it is the tiny details that really thrill someone enough to make them tell your friends about you.</p>
<h2 id="give-a-damn">Give a damn</h2>
<p>Companies have now set the bar so low with their products that they just don&#39;t care anymore.</p>
<p>What you need to do is give a damn about every inch of your product and your customer. You will miles above the competition.</p>
<p>Spend 15 minutes every day improving a small part of your product. Whether that is making your error or email copy more funny or tidying up an interface.</p>
<p><strong>The quality of your life depends on the quality of your questions.</strong></p>
<h2 id="investment">Investment</h2>
<p><strong>Cap the losses</strong>. Be obsessed with not losing money. Negotiate deals which protect against losses. Think long term about fees and middlemen.</p>
<p><strong>Lower risk and get bigger rewards</strong>. Constantly ask &quot;How do I get no risk and get huge rewards?&quot; and because you ask this so often, you believe [there&#39;s an] answer, you will get it.</p>
<p><strong>Setup an asset allocation system.</strong> Stocks are 3x more volatile than bonds. So when you&#39;re 50/50, you&#39;re really 90/10. You&#39;re massively at risk, and that&#39;s why when the markets go down, you get eaten alive. Whatever asset class you invest in, it will drop no less than 50% and more likely 70% at some point. That is why you must diversify.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-principle-is-speed">The first principle is speed</h2>
<p>In order to move fast, I expect you&#39;ll make some foot falls. I am okay with an error rate of 10-20% when making decisions as long as it lets us move fast.</p>
<h2 id="seek-a-single-reason-for-an-action">Seek a single reason for an action</h2>
<p>There needs to be one decisive reason, and then the worthiness of the trip needs to be measured against that one reason. If I go, then we can backfill into the schedule all the other secondary activities. But if I go for a blended reason, I&#39;ll almost certainly come back and feel like it was a waste of time.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-need-to-wait">There is no need to wait</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10 year plan of how to get there, you should ask: Why can&#39;t you do this in 6 months?</p>
<h2 id="your-first-10">Your first 10</h2>
<p>Tell 10 people, show 10 people, share it with 10 people; Choose 10 people who already trust you and like you. If they don&#39;t tell anybody else, it&#39;s not that good and you should start over. If they do tell other people, you&#39;re on your way.</p>
<h2 id="just-focus">Just focus</h2>
<p>Focus on putting out good content daily. Ignore the rest. Make the rules that work for you.</p>
<h2 id="audiobooks-to-listen-to">Audiobooks to listen to</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re feeling stuck listen to <strong>The Art of Possibility by Rosamund Stone Zander</strong> and <strong>The War of Art by Steven Pressfield.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#39;re feeling stressed, it&#39;s about the <strong>Works of Pema Chödrön</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to see a path that is more coloured than the one you&#39;re already on then it&#39;s <strong>Goals: Setting and Achieving Them on Schedule by Zig Ziglar</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to cry a little then it&#39;s <strong>Just Kids by Patti Smith</strong> and <strong>Debt by David Graeber</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="generate-more-ideas">Generate more ideas</h2>
<p>Make a list of 10 ideas every morning. They can range from simple to WTF, as long as you&#39;re working your idea muscle it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p>Heres an example of lists you can do:</p>
<p>10 old ideas I can make new</p>
<p>10 ridiculous things I would invent</p>
<p>10 books I can write</p>
<p>10 business ideas for Google/Amazon/Twitter/etc.</p>
<p>10 people I can send ideas to</p>
<p>10 podcast ideas or videos I can shoot</p>
<p>10 industries where I can remove the middlemen</p>
<p>10 things I disagree with that everyone else assumes is religion.</p>
<p>10 ways to take old posts of mine and turn them into books</p>
<p>10 people I want to be friends with.</p>
<p>10 things I learnt yesterday</p>
<p>10 things I can do differently today.</p>
<p>10 ways I can save time</p>
<p>10 things I learned from X</p>
<p>10 things I&#39;m interested in as a kid that might be fun to explore now.</p>
<p>10 ways I might try to solve a problem I have</p>
<h2 id="when-you-don-t-have-a-single-purpose">When you don&#39;t have a single purpose</h2>
<p>Forget it. It&#39;s okay to be happy without a purpose. The quest for a single purpose has ruined many lives.</p>
<h2 id="affirmations">Affirmations</h2>
<p>Pick a goal and write it down 15 times day. An example would be &quot;I, Scott Adams, will become an Astronaut&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="the-body-model">The Body model</h2>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of these ideas and they&#39;re flowing though my mind, I&#39;m monitoring my body and not my mind. And when my body changes, I have something people are gonna care about to.</p>
<h2 id="diversifying-to-reduce-stress">Diversifying to reduce stress</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not going to worry about losing a friend if I have hundreds of other friends. But i&#39;m really going to worry if I have only two friends.</p>
<h2 id="the-law-of-category">The law of Category</h2>
<p>When you launch a new product, the first question is not &quot;How is this new product better than the competition&quot; but &quot;What category is this new product first in?&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="on-being-unqualified">On being unqualified</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to do stuff you&#39;re not qualified to do.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law said to me, because I was already doing one podcast on current events, &quot;Why don&#39;t you do a Podcast on the stuff you&#39;re talking about here at dinner?&quot;. I said I couldn&#39;t do that. I said, &quot;It&#39;s history, and I&#39;m not qualified to talk about history. I don&#39;t have a doctorate to tell stories&quot;. And then she said, &quot;I didn&#39;t realise you had to have a doctorate to tell stories&quot;. I thought about that for a bit... Most of the great historians from the non-modern era didn&#39;t have doctorates either. They&#39;re just great storytellers, too.</p>
<h2 id="finding-blogs-to-pitch-to">Finding blogs to pitch to</h2>
<p>Find companies similar to yours and for each company do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Save 2-3 images from their site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drag and drop them into the Google reverse image search.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Review the blogs listed that have posted that picture.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fill out a spreadsheet with the Publication, URL, first and last name of the writer, and links to relevant posts by that writer.</p>
<h2 id="when-you-complain-no-one-wants-to-help">When you complain no one wants to help</h2>
<p>If you spend your time focusing on the things that are wrong, and that&#39;s what you express and project to people you know, you don&#39;t become a source of growth for those people, you become a source of destruction for people. That draws more destructiveness.</p>
<h2 id="the-rule-of-3-and-10">The rule of 3 and 10</h2>
<p>Every single thing in your company will break every time you roughly triple in size.</p>
<h2 id="perfection">Perfection</h2>
<p>Hold the standard. Ask for help. Fix it. Do whatever&#39;s necessary. But don&#39;t cheat.</p>
<p>When managing people ask yourself, &quot;Am I basically being unfair because I&#39;m operating from a greater set of information?&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="sell">Sell</h2>
<p>If you go out there and start making noise and making sales. People will find you. Sales cure all. You can talk about how great your business plan is and how well you are going to do. You can make up your own opinions, but you cannot make up your own facts. Sales cure all.</p>
<p>Five days a week, I read my goals before I go to sleep and when I wake up. There are 10 goals around my health, family, business, etc. With expiration dates, and I update them every 6 months.</p>
<p>Money is a great servant but a horrible master.</p>
<h2 id="the-coffee-challenge">The Coffee challenge</h2>
<p>Next time you order coffee, ask for 10% off your next few coffees. It sounds silly, but the whole point is that - in business and in life - you do not have to be on the extreme, but you have to ask for things, and put yourself out there.</p>
<h2 id="life-is-like-a-jar">Life is like a Jar</h2>
<p>Imagine you have a large glass Jar. Next to it, you have a few large Rocks, a small pile of marble sized pebbles, and a pile of Sand. If you put in the sand and pebbles in first, What happens? You cannot fit the big stones in.</p>
<p>But if you were to add the big rocks in first, then the medium sized pebbles and only then add the sand, it all fits.</p>
<p>In other words, the small fits around the big things, but the big things don&#39;t fit around the small.</p>
<h2 id="when-writing">When writing</h2>
<p>First, edit for yourself. What do I like?</p>
<p>Second, edit for your fans. What would be most enjoyable and helpful to my fans?</p>
<p>Thirdly, edit for your haters. What would my detractors try and pick apart, discredit, or make fun of?</p>
<p>Hater-proof your work. Make fun of yourself or bring up likely criticism and address it head on.</p>
<p>Writer&#39;s block does not actually exist... Writer&#39;s block is almost like the equivalent of impotence. It&#39;s performance pressure you put on yourself that keeps you from doing something you naturally should be able to do.</p>
<p>To generate ideas, drop your standards. &quot;Two crappy pages a day&quot; is all it takes. If you hit those two pages you were successful whether or not you ended up using them. At least 50% of the time, you&#39;ll produce perhaps 5, 10 or even 20 pages. Draft ugly, edit pretty.</p>
<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>
<p>The truth is, young creative minds don&#39;t need more ideas, they need to take more responsibility with the ideas they&#39;ve already got.</p>
<h2 id="earning-your-freedom">Earning your freedom</h2>
<p>To actualise the power of freedom, we must merely need to make strategic use (if only for a few weeks for months) of a time-honoured personal freedom technique, popularly known as &#39;quitting&#39;. Despite its pejorative implication, quitting need not be as reckless as it sounds. Many people are able to create vagabonding time through &#39;constructive quitting&#39; -- that is, negotiating with their employers for special sabbaticals and long term leaves of absence.</p>
<h2 id="peter-s-laws-of-life">Peter&#39;s laws of Life</h2>
<p>When given a choice... take both.</p>
<p>Multiple projects lead to multiple successes.</p>
<p>When forced to compromise, ask for more.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t win, change the rules.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t change the rules, then ignore them.</p>
<p>&quot;No&quot; simply means begin again at one level higher.</p>
<p>When in doubt: THINK.</p>
<p>The faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you live.</p>
<p>The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself.</p>
<p>You get what you incentivise.</p>
<p>The day before something is a breakthrough, it&#39;s a crazy idea.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t measure it, you can&#39;t improve it.</p>
<h2 id="take-as-long-as-you-want">Take as long as you want</h2>
<p>Nobody is paying attention to anyone else at all. You think everyone is, but they are not. So take as long as you want if you&#39;re talented. You&#39;ll get their attention again if you have a reason to.</p>
<h2 id="investing-in-happiness">Investing in happiness</h2>
<p>An investment that produces a massive financial ROI but makes me a complete nervous mess, or causes insomnia and temper tantrums for a long period of time, is NOT a good investment.</p>
<h2 id="1842">1842</h2>
<p>The efficient labourer will be found not to crowd is day with work, but will saunter to his task surrounded by a wide halo of ease and leisure. There will be a wide margin for relaxation to his day. He is only earnest to secure the kernels of time, and does not exaggerate the value of outer accoutrements of productivity like busyness or full calendars, or auto-responders.</p>
<p>Those who work much, do not work hard.</p>
<p>Ours is a culture where we wear our ability to get by on very little sleep as a kind of badge of honour that symbolises work ethic, or toughness, or some other virtue -- but really, it&#39;s a total profound failure of priorities and of self respect.</p>
<h2 id="kindle-macbook">Kindle ⇢ Macbook</h2>
<p>Amazon has this function where you can, basically, see your Kindle notes and highlights on the desktop of your computer. Simply copy them and paste them into your note taking app.</p>
<p>Use the kindle app on your IPad? Highlight the text and then screenshot the page and send it over to your desktop via your email provider. Drop the image into an OCR tool (Evernote has one) and extract your notes!</p>
<h2 id="scratch-your-itch">Scratch your itch</h2>
<p>The second you start doing it for an audience, you&#39;ve lost the long game because creating something that is rewarding and sustainable over the long run requires, most of all, keeping yourself excited about it.</p>
<p>It will always show in the work if you resent it.</p>
<h2 id="discipline-equals-freedom">Discipline equals freedom</h2>
<p>Pre-scheduled workouts act as a scaffold around which you can more effectively plan and execute your day.</p>
<p>It also means that if you want freedom in life -- be that financial freedom, more free time, or even freedom from sickness and poor health -- you can only achieve these things through discipline.</p>
<h2 id="take-extreme-ownership">Take extreme ownership</h2>
<p>If I have problems I am going to handle them. I&#39;m going to take care of them, and I&#39;m not going to complain. I took extreme ownership of my world. The way that worked was twofold. When I did need something, it was something significant, it was something real.</p>
<h2 id="4-45am">4:45am</h2>
<p>I like to have that psychological win over the enemy. For me, when I wake up in the morning -- and I don&#39;t know why -- I&#39;m thinking about the enemy and what they&#39;re doing.</p>
<h2 id="detachment">Detachment</h2>
<p>Detaching yourself from the situation, so you can see what&#39;s happening, is absolutely critical.</p>
<h2 id="in-a-bar-what-do-you-order-">In a bar what do you order?</h2>
<p>Water.</p>
<h2 id="the-public-is-friendly">The public is friendly</h2>
<p>The public is not a threat. When you realise that we all need each other, and that we can all learn from each other, your fear goes away.</p>
<h2 id="getting-redder">Getting Redder</h2>
<p>The concept of a red team is designed to test a plan. What happens is, as you develop a plan -- you&#39;ve got a problem and you develop a way to solve that problem -- you fall in love with it. You start to dismiss the short-comings of it, simple because, I think, that&#39;s the way the mind works...</p>
<p>Sometimes you&#39;re actually skipping over real challenges to it, or vulnerabilities in it, because you just want it to work. As we describe it, <strong>sometimes a plan can up being a string of miracles, and that&#39;s not really a solid plan</strong>.</p>
<p>Create a team of people who aren&#39;t wedded to the plan and ask them, &quot;How would you disrupt this plan or how would you defeat this plan?&quot;. If you have a very thoughtful red team, you&#39;ll produce amazing results.</p>
<h2 id="develop-people">Develop people</h2>
<p>Develop people who are going to do the work. Unless you are going to do the task yourself, then the development time you spend on the people who are going to do that task, whether they are going to lead people doing it or they are actually going to do it, every minute you spend on that is leveraged, is exponential return.</p>
<h2 id="80-000-hours">80,000 hours</h2>
<p>You have 80,000 working hours in the course of your life. It&#39;s incredibly important to figure out how best to spend them, and what you&#39;re doing at the moment.</p>
<p>You might be thinking about &quot;How can I do my work as well as possible&quot; and micro optimisation, but not really thinking about &quot;What are actually my ultimate goals in life, and how can I optimise them&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="paradise">Paradise</h2>
<p>Having started Nexus Surf, a premier surf adventure company based in the tropical paradise of Florianopolis, Brazil. He has met his dream girl, a Carioca with caramel-coloured skin named Tatiana, and spent most of his time relaxing under a palm tree or treating clients to the best times of their lives.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not giving up to put your current path on indefinite pause. He could pick up his law career at any time, but that was the furthest thing from his mind.</p>
<p>As he paddles back to shore after an awesome session, his clients get a hold of themselves and regain their composure. They set foot on shore, and reality sinks in: &quot;I would, but I can&#39;t really throw it all away.&quot;</p>
<p>He has to laugh.</p>
<h2 id="premature-optimisation">Premature optimisation</h2>
<p>Being productive is for your middle ages. When you&#39;re young, you want to be prolific and make and do things, but you don&#39;t want to measure them in terms of productivity. You want to measure them in terms of extreme performance, you want to measure them in extreme satisfaction.</p>
<h2 id="imitating-art">Imitating Art</h2>
<p>Perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis.</p>
<p>In order for life to imitate life, you have to have a life. For some art imitates art because all they do is work.</p>
<h2 id="i-love-you">I love you</h2>
<p>Sometimes when we judge other people, it’s just a way to not look at ourselves; a way to feel superior or sanctimonious, or whatever.</p>
<p>Every time you meet someone, just say in your head ‘I love you’ before you have a conversation with them, and that conversation is going to be a lot better. </p>
<h2 id="being-busy">Being busy</h2>
<p>I was able to tell people I was “too busy” to do this or that thing they wanted me to do. I could see why people enjoy this complaint: It makes you feel important, sought-after and put-upon. It’s also unassailable excuse for declining boring invitations, shirking unwelcome projects, and avoiding interaction.</p>
<p>I hated being busy. Every morning my inbox was full of emails asking me to do things I didn’t want to do. It got to the point where I needed to flee to an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>Where I am now, there is no TV. To check emails I must drive to the nearby library. I go a week at a time without seeing anyone I know. I read a lot. I started to get some real writing done.</p>
<p>Nature is free, even if humans have tried to make access to it expensive. Time and quiet should not be luxury items.</p>
<h2 id="be-a-bad-influence">Be a bad influence</h2>
<p>When you’re not drinking, you can see drunkeness more clearly than those actually experiencing it. Unfortunately the only advice I have to offer the Busy is as unwelcome as the advice you’d give the Drunk.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting you quit - just maybe take the rest of the day off. Go play some football. Fuck in the middle of the afternoon. Do whatever. My role in life is to be a bad influence.</p>
<p>Life is too short to be busy.</p>
<h2 id="quick">Quick</h2>
<p>We’re born with everything we would ever need. </p>
<p>You know nothing. So keep learning.</p>
<p>Fail fast. Learn quicker.</p>
<h2 id="become-a-writer">Become a Writer</h2>
<p>Try to write two pages of longhand writing. Go for uninterrupted flow, and don’t stop to edit.</p>
<p>Write about a time when you realised you were mistaken.</p>
<p>Write about a lesson you learned the hard way.</p>
<p>Write about a time you were inappropriately dressed for an occasion.</p>
<p>Write about something you lost that you’ll know you will never get back.</p>
<p>Write about a time when you knew you’d done the right thing.</p>
<p>Write about something you don’t remember.</p>
<p>Write about your darkest teacher.</p>
<p>Write about a memory of a physical injury.</p>
<p>Write about when you knew it was over.</p>
<p>Write about being loved.</p>
<p>Write about what you were really thinking.</p>
<p>Write about how you found your way back.</p>
<p>Write about the kindness of strangers.</p>
<p>Write about why you could not do it.</p>
<p>Write about why you did.</p>
<h2 id="limits-of-the-language">Limits of the language</h2>
<p>The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-hate">Dealing with hate</h2>
<p>It doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it. What matters is how many people do.</p>
<p>10% of people will find a way to take anything personally. Expect it and treat it as math.</p>
<p>When in doubt, starve it of oxygen. Replying only lets them win.</p>
<h2 id="rome">Rome</h2>
<p>If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.</p>
<p>Cato, who Seneca thought to be the perfect Stoic, practiced Epictetus’s maxim by wearing darker robes than was customary and wearing no tunic.</p>
<p>He expected to be ridiculed and was. He did this to train himself to only be ashamed of things truly worth being ashamed of.</p>
<h2 id="cohorts">Cohorts</h2>
<p>If you want to be successful, surround yourself with people who are more successful than you are, but if you want to be happy, surround yourself with people who are less successful than you are.</p>
<p>The first rule to handling conflict is don’t hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict… All of the value in life comes from compound interest. People who regularly fight with others will eventually fight with you.</p>
<h2 id="set-a-standard-for-yourself">Set a standard for yourself</h2>
<p>Tell you friends that you’re a happy person. Then you will be forced to conform to it. You’ll have consistency bias. You have to live up to it. Your friends will expect you to be a happy person.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-every-try-to-be-anything-else">Don’t every try to be anything else</h2>
<p>Be willing to fail or succeed on who you really are. Don’t every try to be anything else. What you are is good enough for whatever it is you’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="strive-for-quality">Strive for quality</h2>
<p>Ending the work day with very high quality, which for one thing means you’re internalizing quality overnight.</p>
<h2 id="fearing-the-same">Fearing the same</h2>
<p>The hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear, projects it onto his opponent, while the coward runs. It’s the same thing - fear - but it’s what you do with it that matters.</p>
<h2 id="seek-discomfort">Seek discomfort</h2>
<p>A person’s success in life can usually be measured by how many uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.</p>
<h2 id="otherside-of-fear">Otherside of fear</h2>
<p>What is on the otherside of fear, if I push through this? The answer is generally nothing. There are few or no negative consequences, or they’re temporary. </p>
<p>Failure is not durable.</p>
<h2 id="act-first">Act First</h2>
<p>You have to act first before inspiration will hit. You don’t wait for inspiration and then act, or you’re never going to act, because you’re never going to have inspiration, not consistently.</p>
<h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2>
<p>You have become a different person in the course of these years. For this is what the art of archery means: a profound and far-reaching contest of the archer with himself. Perhaps you have hardly noticed it yet, but you will feel it very strongly when you meet your friends and acquaintances again in your own country: things will no longer harmonise anymore. You will see with other eyes and measure with other measures.</p>
