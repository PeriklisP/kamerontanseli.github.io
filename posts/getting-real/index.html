<p>This is basically a book on what I discovered whilst working in Tech. So its my own little preacher man sort of. 
It starts out with stripping everything back when it comes to making products. Start out sketching your idea. Have the 
design focus solely on the thing that makes it what it is. A blog is not a blog without an article being present for example.</p>
<p>Do not try to change the world. Instead focus on solving small niche problems that you face personally in your life.</p>
<p>When developing the product do not get sidetracked with fancy features or ideas. Always refer back to the drawing and ask yourself whether this new idea or approach help you achieve this original goal.</p>
<p>Always use tools you are familiar with and enjoy using. Do not use the newest fancy tech. Its about getting stuff out and enjoying it not showboating a new shiny hammer</p>
<p>When selling to people. Give away stuff for free, this will make you stand out in a crowded place. Keep your message as simple as possible. This should already be easy as the product should be refined to solve a single problem.</p>
<p>Ensure the CEO etc answers the support calls so you know exactly what is tripping up your customers. Ask them questions like &quot;If you could take one thing away from the product what would it be?&quot; instead of asking them for features as they will spew whatever fantasy comes to mine</p>
