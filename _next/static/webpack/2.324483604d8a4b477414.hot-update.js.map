I designed the search functionality to be Google-esque in a way. So you can filter down by location by typing: `[category] in [place]` (e.g: Bakeries in Watford).\\n\\nThe app is powered using my favourite stack:\\n\\n* [Node / Express](https://expressjs.com/)\\n* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)\\n* [EJS](https://ejs.co)\\n* [Cutestrap](https://www.cutestrap.com/)\\n* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)\\n\\nIt may seem super boring but it's actually super productive to not have to setup React, Webpack etc to get an app out the door. Especially since this app is just searching for locations.\\n\\nI did write some JavaScript however as I wanted the user to be able to make Poll's to help their friends choose venues. This was done by saving the objects they selected into the Local Storage and then posting it to the server when they click share.\\n\\n![Adding venues with Outy](../static/posts/outy-poll.png)\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
