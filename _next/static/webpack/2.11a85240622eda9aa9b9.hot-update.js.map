I designed the search functionality to be Google-esque in a way. So you can filter down by location by typing: `[category] in [place]` (e.g: Bakeries in Watford).\\n\\nThe app is powered using my favourite stack:\\n\\n* [Node / Express](https://expressjs.com/)\\n* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)\\n* [EJS](https://ejs.co)\\n* [Cutestrap](https://www.cutestrap.com/)\\n* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)\\n\\nIt may seem super boring but it's actually super productive to not have to setup React, Webpack etc to get an app out the door. Especially since this app is just searching for locations.\\n\\nHere's a full list of features:\\n\\n* Location / Category search: Bakeries, Cafes, Muesuems, Bars, Gyms etc\\n* Create Polls to help decide where to go out\\n* Select and save venues for later\\n\\n![Adding venues with Outy](../static/posts/outy-poll.png)\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
