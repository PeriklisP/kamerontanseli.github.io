But first how does one measure their \\\"wasted time\\\"?\\n\\n## Time Tracking\\n\\nThere is probably a million time tracking apps at this point but one tool in particular which I kept getting recommended to me is [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/).\\n\\n![RescueTime](../static/posts/automation-rescuetime.png)\\n\\nRescueTime has a variety of great features that surpass many of the other tracking apps:\\n\\n* Cross Platform Apps: Chrome, Desktop, Mobile.\\n* Daily, Weekly, Monthly summaries.\\n* Huge categorisation database to aggregate from.\\n* Set Goals for how you spend your time\\n* Compare your time against people in the same industry as you\\n\\nI've used RescueTime to identify that I spent way too much time on Instagram and Reddit. Having cut those down my productivity hours has increased to fill those 2-3hrs I was wasting.\\n\\n## Calorie Tracking\\n\\nIf you're into fitness like myself, calorie tracking is a must have for ensuring your body is getting the energy it needs to lose/gain weight.\\n\\nThere are two main apps which fight it out regularly for the best fitness app and those are MyFitnessPal and Lifesum.\\n\\nI'm a Lifesum fan mainly because of their friendly UI and diet plans that they have on the app ðŸ¥—.\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
