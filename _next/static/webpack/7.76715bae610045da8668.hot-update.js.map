I deal with sites with tens of thousands of pages each one having to be high converting and also function as an SEO keyword land grab.\\n\\nAnd yet to no surprise I've never purchased software from a super informative site. I don't care much for testimonials unless they make it a case study and give me real numbers. I don't care if your software can do a million things. **I just care about whether you can solve my problem.**\\n\\nSo to cure my own frustration, let's take a look at what I find to be some amazing landing pages...\\n\\n## 1) Twizzle\\n\\n![Twizzle's Landing Page](../static/posts/landing-pages-cover.png)\\n\\n[Twizzle](https://twizzle.app) is a Twitter client that focuses on messaging and tweeting only. How do I know this? Because they're entire selling point is explained in one sentence. Amazingly done.\\n\\nThe sentence also acts as an interactive example of how the app works. Hovering over the \\\"messaging\\\" box prompts the image on the left to rise to gain the user's attention. \\n\\nThe real kicker is when you hover over the \\\"tweeting\\\" box the Menu Bar example drops down with an interactive tweet box that also works!\\n\\n![A Real Tweeting Box!!!](../static/posts/landing-pages-cover-2.png)\\n\\n### Score: 10/10 - Simple Idea, Amazing Execution.\\n\\n## 2) Walling\\n\\n![Walling's Landing Page](../static/posts/walling-1.png)\\n\\n[Walling](https://walling.app) is an app that helps you organise your ideas into boards. Kinda like Google Keep does but a whole lot prettier.\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
