Three to four hours of which are spent eating.\n\nThat leaves you with around four to six hours to live your life every day.\n\nIf someone is stressing you out or you feel like they are drifting away from you. Let them go. Do not let them waste your precious four hours a day that you have to better yourself and live the life you want.\n\nIf your work makes you feel stuck and doesn't excite you anymore. [Find a way to go remote](https://tim.blog/tag/remote-working/). Save those two hours a day commuting, work on something that makes you happy, and brainstorm how you can change that into your career.\n\nMost importantly be very disciplined with your time. [Jocko Willink](https://twitter.com/jockowillink?s=20), former Navy Seal, puts it succinctly:\n\n> Discipline equals freedom\n\nThe more we control our lives the more we can change the outcome of each day. It's only when we stop and fight for the life we want to live does it actually happen.");
