It’s about controlling yourself at your own game - **Benjamin Graham,** The Intelligent Investor\\n\\nToday I made the decision to stop individually investing in stocks and instead focus entirely on diversified funds.\\n\\nWhy? Well theres three reasons...\\n\\nFirstly with **the recent unemployment figures, ease of access to the stock market (Robinhood), and COVID-19.** \\n\\nI couldn't help but think back to the recklessness of previous financial crises like in 2008 when [mortgage bonds were all time high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) even though they were buit on worthless loans. \\n\\nSecondly **I spent an ungodly amount of time managing and picking stocks which ate away at my attention.** I opened up my trading app more than fifteen times a day.\\n\\nThirdly I realised **my investments were driven by emotions**. The constant speculating and buying/selling resulted in less gains.\\n\\n**Note**: Individual stocks made up 10% of my savings and returned a solid 9% during COVID-19 troubles. 90% of my savings are held in a diversified bonds/stocks [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-gb/) account which on average returns 7% every year.\\n\\n### So What's Next?\\n\\nI'm using Wealthsimple to merge my pension, current stocks & shares ISA, and the money from my stock trading to create  a larger pot.\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
