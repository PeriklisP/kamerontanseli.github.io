The landing page links to the newsletter service.\\n\\n## Revue ($5 per month)\\n\\nThis whole service wouldn't be possible without [Revue](getrevue.co). Revue is an email newsletter service that allows you to build and send emails to a list of email subscribers.\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-17.18.51.png)\\n\\nOne Page a Day's Revue Sign Up Page\\n\\n## Amazon Kindle Free Samples (Free)\\n\\nIn order to provide one page from a new book everyday. I use the \\\"Send a free sample\\\" option to get the first few pages a popular book:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-17.22.28.png)\\n\\nThe free sample contains all that I need to send a teaser of a book to my readers\\n\\nThen if you open it on the [Kindle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-kindle/id302584613) app you can select and copy the text straight out of the sample:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-17.24.13.png)\\n\\nKindle's copy feature\\n\\n**Note:** Amazon limits the amount of text you can copy to stop plagiarism from ebooks.\\n\\nThen all I do is paste it into Revue and correctly format any issues with the text:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-17.25.54.png)\\n\\nCopied Kindle Text into Revue\\n\\n## Amazon Affiliate Links\\n\\nIn order to break even with running costs I add affiliate links at the bottom of every book I send out:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-17.27.56.png)\\n\\nAmazon Affiliate Links\\n\\nYou can add these to your Revue emails by inserting the affiliate link at the bottom of the email:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-17.29.14.png)\\n\\nAmazon Affiliate Link Example\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-17.28.39.png)\\n\\nAdding a link has never been easier\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBuilding an email newsletter startup has never been easier. I could have saved time by using a [no-code website builder](https://squarespace.com) to make the landing page and [outsourcing](https://www.getfriday.com/) the book copy and pasting but all in all it takes me around 1 hour a week to run [One Page a Day](http://onepageday.co.uk/).\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
