I figured it was time for a reflection on my thoughts on what I define as the basis for what I do each and every day.\n\nNot only to share my lessons with you but to also define a structure for future growth engineers to quickly get up to speed\n\n## Choose A Metric\n\n> “You can't manage what you can't measure.” - Peter Drucker\n\nWe begin the process by choosing a metric that we wish to improve. More often then not this will be a baseline metric such as Conversion Rate, Form Fill Rate, Website load time, Engagement, Email Link Clicks, etc.\n\nWhat I tend to do is look at the metric and see if I can see any obvious trends. Has it decreased over time? Does it peak during times of the year? Is there another metric that impacts this metric?\n\nThis is useful further down the line so you can factor in a metric's normal behaviour when you make a change.\n\n## Develop a Hypothesis\n\n> “Quickness is the essence of the war.” - Sun Tzu\n\nNow you must ask yourself how you’ll improve this metric. In order to not get married to a single solution I tend to ask myself a series of questions:\n\n- **What’s impacting this metric?** For metrics such as conversion rate you can observe traffic sources, website load time, etc.\n- **How could I cause this metric to go down?** Useful to think of the opposite for once and do the inverse\n- **Who is responsible for this metric?** You can get a deeper insight by speaking with the person in charge of acquisition etc.\n\nOnce you’ve developed your hypothesis **I recommend finding the smallest possible way to test it**. Whether that be an A/B test or tweaking some variables or copy. The aim is to see if the hypothesis will have an impact on the metric. If a small change can cause a slight shift then implementing the full change will cause an uptick.\n\n## A/B Test it\n\n> “The options are limitless, but each path must begin with the same first step: replacing assumptions” – Tim Ferriss\n\nOnce you’re ready to release your change to the world I recommend partially releasing it to a subset of your traffic. I’ve mentioned previously that you should test your hypothesis with a small tweak which acts as an indicator but when making larger changes I still like to test the effects.\n\nIt has the benefit of being able to quickly see the percentage improvement you’ve delivered compared to the old version of the site. Normally I see a lot of developers skip this step and just deploy the entire change which makes it harder to see the impact in the short term.");
