It’s about controlling yourself at your own game - **Benjamin Graham,** The Intelligent Investor\n\nToday I made the decision to stop individually investing in stocks and instead focus entirely on diversified funds.\n\nWhy? Well theres three reasons...\n\nFirstly with **the recent unemployment figures, ease of access to the stock market (Robinhood), and COVID-19.** \n\nI couldn't help but think back to the recklessness of previous financial crises like in 2008 when [mortgage bonds were all time high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) even though they were buit on worthless loans. \n\nDiversified investments will limit loss and provide a lower but more consistent return over the next 25 years.\n\n![](../static/posts/minimal-investing-one.png)\n\nSecondly **I spent an ungodly amount of time managing and picking stocks which ate away at my attention.** I probably opened up my trading app fifteen times a day.\n\nThirdly I realised **my investments were driven by emotions**. I took time to reflect and realised I was constantly speculating and doubting my investments. If I had just been patient and invested normally I would have made +20% rather than +9%.");
