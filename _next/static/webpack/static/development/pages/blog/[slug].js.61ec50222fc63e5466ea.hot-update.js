It’s about controlling yourself at your own game - **Benjamin Graham,** The Intelligent Investor\n\nToday I made the decision to stop individually investing in stocks and instead focus entirely on diversified funds.\n\nWhy? Well theres three reasons...\n\nFirstly with **the recent unemployment figures, ease of access to the stock market (Robinhood), and COVID-19.** \n\nI couldn't help but think back to the recklessness of previous financial crises like in 2008 when [mortgage bonds were all time high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) even though they were buit on worthless loans. \n\nSecondly **I spent an ungodly amount of time managing and picking stocks which ate away at my attention.** I opened up my trading app more than fifteen times a day.\n\nThirdly I realised **my investments were driven by emotions**. The constant speculating and buying/selling resulted in less gains.\n\n**Note**: Individual stocks made up 10% of my savings and returned a solid 9% during COVID-19 troubles. 90% of my savings are held in a diversified bonds/stocks [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-gb/) account which on average returns  7% every year.");
