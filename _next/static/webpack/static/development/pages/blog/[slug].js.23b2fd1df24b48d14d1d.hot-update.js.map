But at Tray.io our website has over 500 hundred thousand pages. We've definitely stress tested Gatsby.\\n\\nSo here's a few tips that I learn't along the way...\\n\\n## Keep your queries in your component\\n\\nOne issue that did arise when building out 500 hundred thousand generated pages was that we had unknowingly created 70 thousand [page queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/querying-data/#querying-data-with-a-page-query) instead of 1 static query.\\n\\nThe reason this happened was that we had moved the graphql query outside of the component:\\n\\n    const query = graphql`\\n     query {\\n       allBlogPosts {\\n         title\\n       }\\n     }\\n    `\\n    \\n    const SampleComponent = () => (\\n      <StaticQuery \\n       query={query}\\n       render={data => {...}}\\n      />\\n    )\\n    \\n\\nThe reason why this happened was due to two things:\\n\\n1.  We named our query `query` which is a [special name in Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/querying-data/#directions) when they compile the page files (Note: changing the name still had the same effect).\\n2.  The code which decompiles StaticQuery struggles with outside placed queries ( we're still unsure on this)\\n\\nWe saw an decrease in query times by switching to the hook version of `StaticQuery` :\\n\\n    const { site } = useStaticQuery(\\n        graphql`\\n          query {\\n            site {\\n              siteMetadata {\\n                title\\n              }\\n            }\\n          }\\n        `\\n      )\\n    \\n\\nI think this worked because the [check for whether a hook is used is a lot simpler](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/dd344ac4ea292f8b29aa4c55cc08ebc0f19cd761/packages/gatsby/src/query/file-parser.js#L45) compared to the complexity of checking the StaticQuery AST. Less complexity less bugs I guess.\\n\\n## Stop using all in your queries\\n\\nIf you're querying for a single blog post then instead of doing an `all` with a filter, you can filter on the singular object. No more checks for whether `edges` has results:\\n\\n    // before\\n    query Test($slug: String) {\\n      post: allBlogPosts(limit: 1, filter: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {\\n        edges {\\n          node {\\n            title\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n    // after\\n    query Test($slug: String) {\\n      post: blogPost(slug: { eq: $slug }) {\\n        title\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n## Limit the amount of data passed to createPage\\n\\nYou might be tempted like we were to pass down a huge query result to a `pageContext` during build time. But you'd be mistaken...\\n\\nThe `pageContext` is type checked during the build process as it's passed to a page query ([You can turn this off](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/scaling-issues/#switch-off-type-inference-for-sitepagecontext) but I don't recommend it).\\n\\nInstead pass down the slug of the page and use a `StaticQuery` to fetch a one time huge query result.\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
