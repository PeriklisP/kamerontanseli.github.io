We now have hairdressers that will bring the salon to us, robots that can drive us places, and drones to deliver packages for us.\n\nIt's safe to say that all the basic problems have been solved.\n\n### So how do I come up with new ideas?\n\nBe interesting. I mean it. If you like going to gym and you follow a specific diet read everything about that diet. If you work with JavaScript for a living read about design patterns or functional programming.\n\nThe idea is to learn the things that the majority are not willing to learn. It's when you do that you'll find the minority with the problems that they care enough to pay for.");
