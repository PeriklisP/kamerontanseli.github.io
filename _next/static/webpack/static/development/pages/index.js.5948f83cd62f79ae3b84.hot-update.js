I figured it was time for a reflection on my thoughts on what I define as the basis for what I do each and every day.\n\nNot only to share my lessons with you but to also define a structure for future growth engineers to quickly get up to speed\n\n## Choose A Metric\n\n> “You can't manage what you can't measure.” - Peter Drucker\n\nWe begin the process by choosing a metric that we wish to improve. More often then not this will be a baseline metric such as Conversion Rate, Form Fill Rate, Website load time, Engagement, Email Link Clicks, etc.\n\nWhat I tend to do is look at the metric and see if I can see any obvious trends. Has it decreased over time? Does it peak during times of the year? Is there another metric that impacts this metric?\n\nThis is useful for further down the line so you can factor in a metrics normal behaviour when you make a change.");
