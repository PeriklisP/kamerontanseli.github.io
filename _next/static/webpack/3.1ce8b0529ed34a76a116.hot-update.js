But first how does one measure their \"wasted time\"?\n\n## Time Tracking\n\nThere is probably a million time tracking apps at this point but one tool in particular which I kept getting recommended to me is [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/).\n\n![RescueTime](../static/posts/automation-rescuetime.png)\n\nRescueTime has a variety of great features that surpass many of the other tracking apps:\n\n* Cross Platform Apps: Chrome, Desktop, Mobile.\n* Daily, Weekly, Monthly summaries.\n* Huge categorisation database to aggregate from.\n* Set Goals for how you spend your time\n* Compare your time against people in the same industry as you\n\nI've used RescueTime to identify that I spent way too much time on Instagram and Reddit. Having cut those down my productivity hours has increased to fill those 2-3hrs I was wasting.\n\n## Calorie Tracking\n\nIf you're into fitness like myself, calorie tracking is a must have for ensuring your body is getting the energy it needs to lose/gain weight.");
