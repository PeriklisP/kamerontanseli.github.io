But first how does one measure their \\\"wasted time\\\"?\\n\\n## Time Tracking\\n\\nThere is probably a million time tracking apps at this point but one tool in particular which I kept getting recommended to me is [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/).\\n\\n![RescueTime](../static/posts/automation-rescuetime.png)\\n\\nRescueTime has a variety of great features that surpass many of the other tracking apps:\\n\\n* Cross Platform Apps: Chrome, Desktop, Mobile.\\n* Daily, Weekly, Monthly summaries.\\n* Huge categorisation database to aggregate from.\\n* Set Goals for how you spend your time\\n* Compare your time against people in the same industry as you\\n\\nI've used RescueTime to identify that I spent way too much time on Instagram and Reddit. Having cut those down my productivity hours has increased to fill those 2-3hrs I was wasting.\\n\\n## Calorie Tracking\\n\\nIf you're into fitness like myself, calorie tracking is a must have for ensuring your body is getting the energy it needs to lose/gain weight.\\n\\nThere are two main apps which fight it out regularly for the best fitness app and those are [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) and [Lifesum](https://lifesum.com/).\\n\\nI'm a [Lifesum](https://lifesum.com/) fan mainly because of their friendly UI and diet plans that they have on the app ðŸ¥—. But feel free to tray both and see which one works best for your routine:\\n\\n![Lifesum](../static/posts/automation-lifesum.jpg)\\n\\n##Â Task Management\\n\\nWhen it comes to Todo lists there are a few things I look for:\\n\\n1. Clean and simple interface\\n2. Dates/Reminders to do different tasks\\n3. Add descriptions / urls to the todos\\n\\nWith those criteria, I ended up stumbling across [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/home). TickTick is an app which nails the Todo list experience and also helps me jot down every idea/task that I have throughout my day.\\n\\nTickTick also packs in a load of other great features:\\n\\n* Cross Platform Support\\n* Calendar View\\n* Tagging\\n* Habits\\n* Streaks\\n* Prioritising\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
