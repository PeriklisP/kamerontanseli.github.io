I deal with sites with tens of thousands of pages each one having to be high converting and also function as an SEO keyword land grab.\n\nAnd yet to no surprise I've never purchased software from a super informative site. I don't care much for testimonials unless they make it a case study and give me real numbers. I don't care if your software can do a million things. **I just care about whether you can solve my problem.**\n\nSo to cure my own frustration, let's take a look at what I find to be some amazing landing pages...\n\n## 1) Twizzle\n\n![Twizzle's Landing Page](../static/posts/landing-pages-cover.png)\n\n[Twizzle](https://twizzle.app) is a Twitter client that focuses on messaging and tweeting only. How do I know this? Because they're entire selling point is explained in one sentence. Amazingly done.\n\nThe sentence also acts as an interactive example of how the app works. Hovering over the \"messaging\" box prompts the image on the left to rise to gain the user's attention. \n\nThe real kicker is when you hover over the \"tweeting\" box the Menu Bar example drops down with an interactive tweet box that also works!\n\n![A Real Tweeting Box!!!](../static/posts/landing-pages-cover-2.png)\n\n### Score: 10/10 - Simple Idea, Amazing Execution.\n\n## 2) Walling\n\n![Walling's Landing Page](../static/posts/walling-1.png)\n\n[Walling](https://walling.app) is an app that helps you organise your ideas into boards. Kinda like Google Keep does but a whole lot prettier.\n\nWhat drew me to their landing page in particular is their use of whitespace and clear copy to drive home what they're trying to achieve.\n\nTheir opening line, \"A Better Way to Organize & Refine Ideas\", let's the user know what the main purpose of this app is. Simply put they have made a better way to take and organise notes or designs.\n\nWhats also cool is that their subtitle goes through different use cases for the app: \"Working on a project, researching a topic or writing an article?\". This done to relate to the customers wants as most note taking app customers are using the tool in 1 of those 3 ways.\n\nLet's talk about CTAs, especially when you have 3 of them. It can be tempting to make each CTA of equal importance but this would spell confusion and add a lack of direction for the customer.\n\nInstead Walling has made the sign up form huge and prominent compared to the rest of the CTAs. Not looking to give up your email yet? Why not watch a video of how it works? Not interested in watching a video? Try a demo of our product! They covered each different type of interest level and kept it from being problematic by having each level reduce in size and colour.\n\n![Walling's Landing Page](../static/posts/walling-2.png)\n\nScrolling down reveals why we should use Walling. They have kept it rather brief in order to show off the true USP of the product which is it's User Interface, which you can see playing as a GIF in the right hand side.\n\nLet's go through each reason:\n\n1. \"Brain dump with ease\"");
