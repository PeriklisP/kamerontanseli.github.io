I designed the search functionality to be Google-esque in a way. So you can filter down by location by typing: `[category] in [place]` (e.g: Bakeries in Watford).\\n\\nThe app is powered using my favourite stack:\\n\\n* [Node / Express](https://expressjs.com/)\\n* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)\\n* [EJS](https://ejs.co)\\n* [Cutestrap](https://www.cutestrap.com/)\\n* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)\\n\\nIt may seem super boring but it's actually super productive to not have to setup React, Webpack etc to get an app out the door.\""],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
