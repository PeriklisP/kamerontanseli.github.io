I'm going with the Bailard template:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.10.23.png)\\n\\nThe existing template has a really good Hero title :)\\n\\nLet's change up the copy to reflect what we're trying to achieve with this website:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.17.11.png)\\n\\nThis is why I love Squarespace\\n\\nLooking good! Now under our next section we need to add a code element (don't worry you're not going to be coding). In order to do that you need to:\\n\\n1.  Add a blank section. It will be the first option.\\n2.  Click the inner text element prompt:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.19.06.png)\\n\\nWhatever you call what this is\\n\\n3\\\\. Click the Code option\\n\\n## Curating the Challenges Database\\n\\nNow that we have a website to display our challenges. We also need a database to host our challenges. Introducing [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), It's a spreadsheet on steroids and if you've read any no-code article before this one you've most likely heard about it.\\n\\nSo let's create a new workspace/table for 30 day challenges:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.20.43.png)\\n\\nI should probably make the icon fancier\\n\\nOnce you've done that let's head on over to the table itself and add a few fields:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.22.56.png)\\n\\nOur brand new challenges database\\n\\nI've added 5 fields for our challenges:\\n\\n1.  Title (single text) - Short summary of what the challenge is\\n2.  Description (long text) - Long form content on what to do everyday\\n3.  Author (single text) - For the user to add their Twitter for clout\\n4.  Difficulty (number) - Out of 5 how difficult is this challenge\\n5.  ID (auto-increment) - Auto incrementing ID just in case ;)\\n\\nLet's add some example challenges just so we have something to display:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.25.49.png)\\n\\nI've added my challenges but feel free to add your own\\n\\nTo add the Table to our site we need to click the \\\"Share\\\" button in the top right corner:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.26.26.png)\\n\\nClick that juicy share button. Go on!\\n\\nThen you want to click on the create shared view option:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.27.34.png)\\n\\nNext click the share current view option:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.28.05.png)\\n\\nThen click the create embeddable link button (you think they would make this have less steps???):\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.28.39.png)\\n\\nAnd then click the embed in your site option:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.29.33.png)\\n\\nYou'll be taken to a [page like this](https://airtable.com/shrA5hwzrkPVye5pN/embed):\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.30.29.png)\\n\\nSet the options to use card layout and disallow filtering for now:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.31.10.png)\\n\\n## Displaying our Challenges\\n\\nThen **copy the embed code** and head back to the website to paste it into the code block:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.22.31.png)\\n\\nWhy are embeds always a premium option :(\\n\\nYou website now should look something like this:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)\\n\\nLooking SpicyÂ \\n\\n## Adding Google Calendar Support\\n\\nHow do we add GCal support without writing any code? Links! Google calendar supports a certain format of URL which can automatically add events to a users calendar.\\n\\nLet's use this [free tool](https://jennamolby.com/tools/google-calendar-link-generator/) to see what the URL should look like:\\n\\n    http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20200501T010000Z%2F20200530T010000Z&text=30%20Day%20Challenges\\n    \\n\\nAs you can see from the above URL we need to add:\\n\\n1.  _action=TEMPLATE_ - This tells Gcal that this link is for making an event\\n2.  _dates_ - This is how we set the dates for Gcal to add the event\\n\\nIn order to add this functionality to Airtable we're gonna have to write a formula. So let's first make a new field called \\\"Add to Calendar\\\":\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.33.43.png)\\n\\nFormulas allow us to manipulate values using functions that Airtable provides. I've put together a formula to generate the calendar links:\\n\\n    CONCATENATE('http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=', DATETIME_FORMAT(NOW(), 'YYYYMMDD'), '%2F', DATETIME_FORMAT(DATEADD(NOW(), 30, 'day'), 'YYYYMMDD'), '&text=', ENCODE_URL_COMPONENT(Title))\\n    \\n\\nNow if we go back to our site we'll see that our entries have \\\"Add to Calendar\\\" links:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.47.35.png)\\n\\nWooHoo now you can click and add it to your calendar!\\n\\n## Adding Submissions\\n\\nIn order to add submissions we need to create an Airtable form. To do so create another table and call it \\\"Submissions\\\":\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.50.54.png)\\n\\n*   Email\\n*   Title (single text)\\n*   Description (long form text)\\n*   Twitter Handle (single text)\\n*   Challenge Difficulty (select with options 1 - 5)\\n\\nAdd the above five fields and then follow the steps we did earlier to embed a table but instead select the form view option:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.51.57.png)\\n\\nPlease select \\\"Create a form view\\\"\\n\\nYou'll be rewarded by seeing a form like this appear:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.53.58.png)\\n\\nAirtable is a lifesaver\\n\\nClick \\\"Share form\\\", copy the link and add it to your website:\\n\\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.56.02.png)\\n\\nAlmost like magic\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe've made it! We have a [running site](https://horse-vuvuzela-ph4p.squarespace.com/home) (password is 30days). As you can see we can view and add challenges to our calendar as well as submit challenges using the button in the top right corner.\\n\\nThe world is your oyster now. Go and create some kick ass sites.
