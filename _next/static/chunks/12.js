For the majority of you, you've bought one. Was it good? Maybe.\n\nThe issue is that it's hard to find good self-help books with methods that actually work. Amazon reviews aren't to be trusted, GoodReads is pretty shit. So what do we have left to base our judgment on?\n\nAfter reading a Wired article on the 4 Hour Work Week I realised how insightful the author's attempt was to journal the effectiveness of the self-help books. I began to wonder if this style of experimentation could be applied to other books...\n\nSo in the name of science, I'm creating a series called \"1 Week Self-Help\" where I attempt the methods from popular self-help books, document my journey, and rate them based on their effectiveness.\n\nYou should sign up using the form below so you don't miss my first review.");
