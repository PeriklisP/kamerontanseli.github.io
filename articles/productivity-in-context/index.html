<p>Every time we go online we are barraged with content that tells us how unproductive we are. It tells us that the fact that we don&#39;t wake up at 5am everyday makes us lazy or have a lack of discipline.</p>
<p>This content fails to recognise that not everyone can wake up at 5am and feel great about it. Responsibilities such as children or late night shifts can cause sleep loss. Biological differences such as being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_(person)">night time person can also affect our wake up times.</a></p>
<p>When you see this content out on the web pause and think about whether it will actually make you happy and fit into your life. The worst thing you can do is ruin your happiness in the sake of 1 hour of extra productivity.</p>
