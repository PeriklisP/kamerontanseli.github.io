<p>I had a recent bout of sadness regarding issues I faced in my workplace. The funny thing is that the issues didn&#39;t actually exist. It was all caused by me.</p>
<p>I would approach every situation with a feeling of negativity. My own lack of motivation would cause projects to fail and small details to pass through unnoticed. I was in a spiral of sadness because I lacked self-worth.</p>
<p>At the time I was fortunately reading a book called &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Messy-Middle-Finding-Through-Hardest/dp/0241310172">The Messy Middle</a>&quot;. It was written by the guy that founded <a href="https://behance.net">Behance.net</a>, which later sold to Adobe.</p>
<p>He had this chapter called &quot;Do your fucking job&quot;, where he talked about <strong>how we need to do the hard things in order to progress, be unique and ultimately get shit done</strong>.</p>
<p>It was so profound to me that I now repeat the phrase, &quot;Do you fucking job&quot;, before I go into any meeting or have to tackle a big problem.</p>
<p>I guess sometimes you just need a good old slap to the face to jump start things again.</p>
