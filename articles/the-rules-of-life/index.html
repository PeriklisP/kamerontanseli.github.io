<ol>
<li><p><strong>Live in the present</strong>. There is no other time than the now. Notice things around you, focus on the person in front of you. Be in that moment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eat with others</strong>. There is nothing more fulfilling than to sit with friends and enjoy food and drink till the sunsets.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Put yourself into your work</strong>. Be in a state of flow as you work. Retreat somewhere quiet and focus solely on putting energy into producing the most beautiful work yet. <strong>Do not force yourself to work as the lack of desire will show in the end result</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pause and reflect often</strong>. Learn to meditate, control your thoughts and feelings. Rise above anxiety and sad thoughts and you shall conquer any challenge ahead of you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eat well and train your body</strong>. Much like a machine our bodies begin to rust if we do not put them work. Eat what is natural and unprocessed. Train the body through natural movements such as: walking, running, swimming or weightlifting.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Walk away from noise</strong>. Learn to love the joy of silence. It shall be your friend in your endeavour to think more clearly and passionately.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get enough sleep</strong>. Sleep is our save button. It takes everything we learnt from today and stores it away in our mind as we sleep. Let it have the 7+ hours it needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Work for yourself</strong>. You can never be free as long as you work under strict constraints. Find a way to allow yourself the freedom of choice.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Read philosophy</strong>. Religion chose to exile philosophers and call them heretics because philosophers questioned the very notion of why we live and do what we do. If there is any hope of clarity in one&#39;s life it is through the teaching of philosophy that they will find it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Seek pleasure of the mind</strong>. One off physical pleasures only exist in that exact moment but pleasures of mind live in the past and future. Feelings of joy, the lack of fear, and pleasant memories are all examples of pleasures of the mind.</p>
