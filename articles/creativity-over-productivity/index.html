<p>All too often we give up early with side projects.</p>
<p>We are too focused on spinning them into products immediately and focusing on the building a company.</p>
<p>Not only does this add unneeded stress to ship fast but it also hampers quality of work.</p>
<p>Not everything needs to be a startup or a sass app straight out the door. Instead we should focus on being creative and taking the time to craft tools that we would utilise in our day to day lives.</p>
<p>The hypothesis here is that if you will be less stressed, more driven and happier. So your end result will be of a higher quality and have a greater chance of success.</p>
