<h2 id="to-build-products-that-help-increase-the-daily-productivity-of-10-000-people-"><em>To build products that help increase the daily productivity of 10,000 people.</em></h2>
<p>What do I mean by productivity?</p>
<p><strong>Sleep</strong></p>
<p>We need at least 8 hours of sleep. Something not everyone currently has the habit of doing.</p>
<p>I will help more people sleep which will help them have more energy to tackle the tasks ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism">Essentialism</a> is the key to ensuring people stay on top of work. Most todo lists help you list our tasks but non help you cut down on them.</p>
<p>I will help reduce the amount of tasks people focus on by teaching them the power of &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Movement</strong></p>
<p><a href="/articles/go-outside">I talked about the great power of walking</a> as a way to calm the mind and generate ideas. Exercise is important, it builds a framework around one&#39;s life and improves discipline and confidence in the individual.</p>
<p>I will help people move more throughout the day to ensure they stay healthy and have moments of calmness.</p>
