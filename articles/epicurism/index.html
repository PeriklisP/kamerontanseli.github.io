        <h1 id="epicurism">Epicurism</h1>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>Epicurus believed that what he called &quot;pleasure&quot; (ἡδονή) was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one&#39;s desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility.</p>
<p>Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. Epicureans shunned politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions which can directly conflict with the epicurean pursuit for peace of mind and virtues.</p>
<p>Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of pleasure possible during one&#39;s lifetime, yet doing so moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in such pleasure.</p>
<p>Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than on physical pleasures.</p>
<p>Epicurus actively recommended against passionate love, and believed it best to avoid marriage altogether. He viewed recreational sex as a natural, but not necessary desire that should be generally avoided.</p>
<p>The Epicurean understanding of justice was inherently self-interested. Justice was deemed good because it was seen as mutually beneficial. Individuals would not act unjustly even if the act was initially unnoticed because of possibly being caught and punished. Both punishment and fear of punishment would cause a person disturbance and prevent them from being happy.</p>
<p>Epicurus laid great emphasis on developing friendships as the basis of a satisfying life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>of all the things which wisdom has contrived which contribute to a blessed life, none is more important, more fruitful, than friendship — Cicero</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we say . . . that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul. - Letter to Menoeceus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Epicurus rejected any possibility of an afterlife, while still contending that one need not fear death: &quot;Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.</p>
<p>From this doctrine arose the Epicurean Epitaph: Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo (&quot;I was not; I was; I am not; I do not care&quot;).</p>
<h3 id="ethics">Ethics</h3>
<p>Epicureanism divided pleasure into two broad categories: pleasures of the body and pleasures of the mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pleasures of the body: These pleasures involve sensations of the body, such as the act of eating delicious food or of being in a state of comfort free from pain, and exist only the present. <strong>One can only experience pleasures of the body in the moment, meaning they only exist as a person is experiencing them</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Pleasures of the mind: These pleasures involve mental processes and states; feelings of joy, the lack of fear, and pleasant memories are all examples of pleasures of the mind. <strong>These pleasures of the mind do not only exist in the present, but also in the past and future, since memory of a past pleasant experience or the expectation of some potentially pleasing future can both be pleasurable experiences. Because of this, the pleasures of the mind are considered to be greater than those of the body.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Epicureans further divided each of these types of pleasures into two categories: kinetic pleasure and katastematic pleasure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kinetic pleasure: Kinetic pleasure describes the physical or mental pleasures that involve action or change. Eating delicious food, as well as fulfilling desires and removing pain, which is itself considered a pleasurable act, are all examples of kinetic pleasure in the physical sense.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Katastematic pleasure: Katastematic pleasure describes the pleasure one feels while in a state without pain. Like kinetic pleasures, katastematic pleasures can also be physical, such as the state of not being thirsty, or mental, such as freedom from a state of fear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Epicurus distinguishes three kinds of desires: the natural and necessary, the natural but not necessary, and those that are neither natural or necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Natural and necessary: These desires are limited desires that are innately present in all humans; it is part of human nature to have them. They are necessary for one of three reasons: necessary for happiness, necessary for freedom from bodily discomfort, and necessary for life. Clothing would belong to the first two categories, while something like food would belong to the third.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Natural but not necessary: These desires are innate to humans, but they do not need to be fulfilled for their happiness or their survival. Wanting to eat delicious food when one is hungry is an example of a natural but not necessary desire. The main problem with these desires is that they fail to substantially increase a person&#39;s happiness, and at the same time require effort to obtain and are desired by people due to false beliefs that they are actually necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not natural nor necessary: These desires are neither innate to humans nor required for happiness or health; indeed, they are also limitless and can never be fulfilled. Desires of wealth or fame would fall under this category, and such desires are to be avoided because they will ultimately only bring about discomfort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If one follows only natural and necessary desires, then, according to Epicurus, one would be able to reach aponia and ataraxia and thereby the highest form of happiness.</p>
<p>Because Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (telos), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ataraxia (tranquility, freedom from fear) and aponia (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia.</p>
