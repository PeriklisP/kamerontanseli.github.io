      <h1 id="the-entrepreneurial-mindset-disease">The Entrepreneurial Mindset Disease</h1>
<p>Having recently snapped out of the Entrepreneurial Mindset Disease. I have taken the liberty of writing an extensive overview of what I think is a huge problem within the Entrepreneur community.</p>
<h2 id="stage-one-the-plague-of-instagram">Stage One: The plague of Instagram</h2>
<p>Instagram caters itself to whatever will drive you onto the app more. This is part of what makes instagram an addicting and successful social media app.</p>
<p>Unfortunately business/entrepreneurial content is quite thrilling and addicting. I mean who wouldn’t want to be told they can be a millionaire by 35!</p>
<p>Because of this a lot of younger people, especially those who are struggling with money, get hooked into watching this sort of content. Instagram being Instagram continuously feeds this habit.</p>
<h2 id="stage-two-the-paranoia-of-fomo">Stage Two: The paranoia of FOMO</h2>
<p>Seeing others get filled with hope and start businesses is a great sight to behold. But it comes with a cost. If the person is in stage one of the disease they will begin to suffer from FOMO (Fear of missing out).</p>
<p>This will cause time anxiety and force the individual to give up their spare time in the devotion of one day building a successful business.</p>
<p>But in doing so they will also cause FOMO in others and the virus continues its cycle.</p>
<h2 id="stage-three-the-paralysis-of-courses">Stage Three: The paralysis of courses</h2>
<p>Having forgotten about their hobbies or interests the individual will then fail to come up creative ideas. This will force the individual to look for ideas/help in pursuing an idea to build a business. </p>
<p>The causes of the disease, those how make the content in Stage One, will offer courses/books/podcasts sometimes for a price which will list out business ideas or markets to enter into.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the individual has no interest in said markets and won’t have the patience to sit through and provide a product of value to that niche community. Instead due to FOMO they will begin to get impatient as there’s no quick returns and buy more content to pursue other markets.</p>
<p>This will keep the individual in a constant cycle of paralysis in which they will make 0 progress in any chosen direction.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-avoid-falling-into-this-trap-">How to avoid falling into this trap.</h2>
<p>Almost every great business started off with a founder that had a hobby. Whether it was telling their friends what they’re doing, collecting coupons or fiddling around trying to make computers. </p>
<p>It was an interest that enabled them to see the pain points of that specific niche community and build a great products that they themselves would love and work hard towards.</p>
<p>To avoid The Entrepreneurial Mindset Disease you must:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Delete Instagram/Twitter or Unfollow entrepreneurial accounts.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Tell your entrepreneurial friends that you don’t want to talk business when you meet up.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stop reading the news</strong> (it causes a load of anxiety).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take up a hobby in your new found spare time (Avoid feeling that you need to find a new idea within your hobby, instead just enjoy your hobby).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take regular breaks (1 week at time) where you don’t have your laptop etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enjoy your life and take it easy. <strong>Happiness is derived from gratitude not from desires.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-personal-note-of-mine">A personal note of mine</h2>
<p>I still continue to work in the evenings on tools. One of my most recent obsessions is bringing minimalism to the front end especially with our tooling/frameworks. </p>
<p>But I don’t let it consume my life. At anytime I could walk away from it and not feel anxiety that I’m wasting my time. </p>
<p>This is the key to contentfulness, <strong>I do have goals but I don’t dictate every minute of my time as to whether I’m hitting them or not</strong>.</p>

<p>“When there is no desire, all things are at peace.” ― Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching</p>
