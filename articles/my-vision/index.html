        <h1 id="my-vision-">My Vision.</h1>
<p>When I was thirteen I saw the world as this place where if you wanted to be something, the world would mold itself to be that thing for you. I remember seeing all these <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/09/15/18-entrepreneurs-under-18-teen-business/">genius under 18-year-olds</a> and I would get so angry and worked up. I would say to myself “Kameron, why the fuck are you not running a company yet? Why is it that these kids can just start a $2.5m a year business while you have to do your fucking GCSEs/SATs”.</p>
<p>Fast forward 7 years. I’m still testing ideas, markets, and channels but to no success. I’m frustrated at myself and it shows. I’m harsh with myself to build discipline, going as far to wake up at 5 am, workout, read a book, network with someone, work for at least 3 hours on side-work and then do full-time work. Because I want this vision so bad. </p>
<p>All my life I wanted to be a CEO. I looked at every boss I ever had as a sort of father figure. One time even taking advice to break up with my long term girlfriend (I fixed that). People would say to me about the long hours and the hardships of dealing with people and the potential to not get a great exit etc. But fuck that, that’s not why I want to a CEO. </p>
<p>I want to be a CEO because I want to share my vision with the world in how a company should run. I want my employees to wake up every day and feel excited to turn on the laptops and do work that matters. I want my employees to work whenever, wherever because I don’t pay for seat warmers. I want to build software that helps improve people, make them better, wiser, stronger and more able to tackle the world’s problems. Each one of us needs a mini Y-Combinator in our pockets and I’m gonna be the one to make that happen.</p>
<p>Why am I so passionate about building a vision? Well, I can attest it to every time I have been fucked over by a company. Every time I join a company and after 2-3 weeks realize they drum to the same beat as the rest of the startups. Not a single one pushing a metric, rallying employees, testing campaigns or building actual MVPs (don’t get me started on that). </p>
<p>It’s just not the way a company should be run. It’s no surprise to me that 1/3 companies fail after 3 years. Innovation requires beating to a different tune. It requires such an out-there thinking model. I’m not saying I’ve achieved that. My vision is rather just around how companies should be a mix of Basecamp, IMVU, and Mint. Great culture, amazing product research/discovery and a systemic marketing strategy.</p>
<p>So to everyone out there, just sitting around watching YouTube or trying to start a dropshipping business because some guy on Instagram told you to do so with his $200 course. Think bigger. Go do something really far outside where you think it’s impossible to go. Build the next top consultancy or go be a 2m+ influence or go start a Dog charity. Just go fucking do it. </p>
