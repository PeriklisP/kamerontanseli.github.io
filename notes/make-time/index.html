<blockquote>
<p>There is more to life than increasing its speed. - Mahatma Gandhi</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-process">The Process</h4>
<p>The first step is choosing a single highlight to prioritise in your day. Next you employ tactics to stay laser-focused on that highlight. Finally throughout the day you build up energy so you can stay in control of your time and attention.</p>
<p>The best tactics are the ones that fit into your day. They&#39;re not something you force yourself to do; They&#39;re just something you do. And in most cases, they&#39;ll be things you want to do.</p>
<h4 id="highlight-start-each-day-by-choosing-a-focal-point">Highlight: Start Each Day by choosing a Focal Point</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfection is a distraction another shiny object taking your attention away from your real priorities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every day, you&#39;ll choose a single activity to prioritise and protect it in your calendar. Your Highlight isn&#39;t the only thing you&#39;ll do each day. But it will be your priority.</p>
<p>Choosing your daily Highlight starts with asking yourself the question: <em>What do I want to be the highlight of my day?</em>. The Highlight should take 60 - 90 minutes.</p>
<p>So how should you decide? We use three different criteria to choose our highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urgency: What&#39;s the most pressing thing I have to do today? </li>
<li>Satisfaction: At the end of the day, which highlight will bring me the most satisfaction?</li>
<li>Joy: When I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have something that absolutely positively must be accomplished today, make it your Highlight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work - Mary Oliver</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should adjust your technology so you can find Laser mode. Simple changes like logging out of Social Media or scheduling batch processes to check emails can have a huge effect.</p>
<h4 id="energize-use-the-body-to-recharge-the-brain">Energize: Use the Body to Recharge the Brain</h4>
<p>To achieve focus and make time for what matters, your brain needs energy, and that energy comes from taking care fo your body. That is why its important to charge your battery with exercise, food, sleep, quiet and face-to-face time.</p>
<h4 id="reflect-adjust-and-improve-your-system">Reflect: Adjust and Improve Your System</h4>
<p>Before going to bed, you should take a few notes. This will help you decide on which tactics you want to continue and which ones you want to refine or drop.</p>
<h4 id="highlight-tactics">Highlight Tactics</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not remember days, we remember moments - Cesare Pavese</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing more doesn&#39;t help you create time for what matters; it just makes you feel even more frazzled and busy. And when you&#39;re busy day after day, time slides by in a blur.</p>
<p>Setting goals seemed more meaningful than optimising my to-do list but I still felt adrift. These objectives were too far away to be motivating. All of a sudden I&#39;d realise that I was working towards a goal that no longer mattered to me. And living a &quot;someday&quot; life was demoralising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not good enough yet, but I will be when I reach my goal&quot; - James Clear</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start to think less about to-do lists and more about substantial projects like leading design workshops and spending a day fixing software bugs with engineers.</p>
<p><strong>Write your Highlight down</strong></p>
<p>Make writing down your Highlight a simple daily ritual. You can do it any time, but the evening (before bed) and the morning work best for most people.</p>
<p><strong>Do yesterday again</strong></p>
<p>If you&#39;re not sure what to choose as your Highlight, you can do yesterday again.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you didn&#39;t get to your Highlight, it&#39;s probably still important. Repeat for a second chance.</li>
<li>If you started your Highlight but didn&#39;t finish it or if your Highlight was part of a bigger project, today is the perfect day to make progress or start a personal sprint.</li>
<li>If you&#39;re establishing a new skill or routine, you&#39;ll need repetition to cement the behaviour. Repeat to build momentum and create habits.</li>
<li>If yesterday&#39;s Highlight brought you joy or satisfaction, there&#39;s nothing wrong with more of that! Repeat to keep you happy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stack Rank Your Life</strong></p>
<p>Try this recipe to rank your big priorities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a list of the big things that matter in your life<ul>
<li>Include only big stuff and try to use one or two word titles</li>
<li>Don&#39;t prioritise the list yet, just write it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the one most important thing<ul>
<li>Consider whats most meaningful to you, not what is most urgent.</li>
<li>Think about what needs the most effort.</li>
<li>Follow your heart.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t sweat it - the list isn&#39;t set in stone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the second, third, fourth and fifth most important things.</li>
<li>Rewrite the list in order of priority</li>
<li>Draw a circle around number one.</li>
<li>Use the list to help you choose your Highlight.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Batch the little stuff</strong></p>
<p>Bundle up small tasks and use batch processing to get them all done in one Highlight session. When you catch up all at once instead of constantly trying to keep your inbox or to-do list empty, you supercharge that feeling of satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>The Might-Do List</strong></p>
<p>Separate the decision about what to do from the act of doing it. Make a list of things you might do. Projects sit on your Might-Do List until you decide to make them your highlight and schedule them on your calendar.</p>
<p><strong>The Burner List</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Divide a sheet of paper into two columns<ul>
<li>Left hand columns is going to be your front burner and the right hand column will be your back burner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put your most important project on the front burner<ul>
<li>You are allowed one and only one project on the front burner.</li>
<li>In the top left corner write the name of your project and then underneath it write the todo items for that project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leave the rest of the first column empty.</li>
<li>Put your second most important project in the back burner.<ul>
<li>In the top right-hand column write the name of your project and then underneath it write the todo items for that project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make a kitchen sink<ul>
<li>About halfway down the right-hand column list any misc tasks that you need to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Run a Personal Sprint</strong></p>
<p>Choose the same Highlight for several days in a row, breaking it up into steps for each day if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Explode your Highlight</strong></p>
<p>Break your Highlight into small, easy-to-do bits. Note that each item should include a verb, be specific, small and relatively easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shifting your focus to something that your mind perceives as a doable, completable task will create a real increase in positive energy, direction and motivation. - David Alllen</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Schedule Your Highlight</strong></p>
<p>If you want to make time for your Highlight, this tactic could hardly be simpler:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think about how much time you want for your Highlight</li>
<li>Think about when you want to do your Highlight</li>
<li>Put your Highlight on the calendar</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Block Your Calendar</strong></p>
<p>Use daily &quot;do not schedule&quot; blocks to make room for your Highlight.</p>
<p>Play offence, not defence. Don&#39;t use your &quot;do not schedule&quot; blocks just to avoid coworkers or get out of meetings. Be intentional with anytime you block out.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t be greedy. Don&#39;t fill up your calendar entirely. Leave space for you coworkers they will appreciate it.</p>
<p>Take it seriously. If you don&#39;t take those commitments seriously, other people won&#39;t either.</p>
<p><strong>Just Say No</strong></p>
<p>Be nice but honest. Don&#39;t try to make up excuses or defer the decision indefinitely. You can offer help or guidance to someone who can help that person instead of out right declining the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Design Your Day</strong></p>
<p>When you don&#39;t have a plan, you have to decide constantly what to do next, and you might get distracted thinking about all the things you should or could do. But a completely planned day provides freedom to focus on the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Become a morning person</strong></p>
<p>Start with Light, Coffee, and Something to Do. Don&#39;t underestimate the importance of light in waking up. Humans are hardwired to wake when it&#39;s light and get sleepy when it&#39;s dark. But if you want to make time for your Highlight before the workday, you can&#39;t wait for sunrise.</p>
<p>Coffee is important. Caffeine is nice, but the preparation routine is essential to my morning. It takes fifteen minutes to make coffee using a simple pour-over technique. This process is more labor-intensive than using a machine. This keeps me occupied during the low-willpower period when I would otherwise check email or look at Twitter.</p>
<p>Adjust your environment to wind down and signal &quot;bedtime&quot; to your body. Begin by lowering the lights and making your bed ready to be slept in.</p>
<p><strong>Nighttime is Highlight Time</strong></p>
<p>Refresh your brain with a real break. At the end of the working day read a book, watch part of a movie or clean the kitchen, etc. These activities will recharge your mental energy.</p>
<p>Around 9:30pm, switch to working on your Highlight. If possible try to go offline so you don&#39;t get distracted by notifications etc.</p>
<p>Be sure before bed to dim the lights and wind down as working late will keep your mind occupied.</p>
<p><strong>Quit When You&#39;re Done</strong></p>
<p>End the day before you get exhausted, your week&#39;s productivity will increase dramatically as a result. You can do this by finding the perfect time of day to stop (5pm is a usual example).</p>
<h4 id="lazer-tactics">Lazer Tactics</h4>
<p><strong>Create a Distraction-Free Phone</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Delete Social apps.</li>
<li>Delete other apps such as games, news and streaming video apps.</li>
<li>Delete email accounts and remove your account from your phone.</li>
<li>Remove/Disable the Web browser.</li>
<li>Keep everything else.<ul>
<li>Music/Map/Delivery/Calendar/Weather/Travel apps are harmless as they&#39;re tools rather than endless distraction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Log Out</strong></p>
<p>Websites likes to cache your username and password to make it easier for you login next time around. Make it harder to use your distractions by logging out of the app every time you use it.</p>
<p><strong>Turn off all notifications</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go into your phone&#39;s settings, find the list of notifications and turn them off one by one.</li>
<li>Leave only the critical and useful ones.</li>
<li>Be sure to turn off email and IM notifications. These feel critical but the truth is that most of us can live without them.</li>
<li>Whenever a new app asks &quot;Is it okay to show notifications&quot; choose &quot;No&quot;.</li>
<li>Try it for 48 hours. See how it works for you.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Clear Your Home-screen</strong></p>
<p>A blank Home-screen offers a tiny moment of quiet every time you open your phone. It&#39;s an intentional inconvenience, a small pause keeping distraction one step away.</p>
<p><strong>Wear a Watch (not a smart one)</strong></p>
<p>A Watch replaces the need to pull out your phone every time you need to check the time. Stopping you from potentially getting distracted.</p>
<p><strong>Skip the Morning Check-In</strong></p>
<p>The longer you postpone the morning check-in until 9am or 10am or even after lunch the longer you preserve that feeling of calm.</p>
<p><strong>Ignore the News</strong></p>
<p>&quot;If it bleeds, it leads&quot; is a newsroom cliche, but it&#39;s true. Most news is bad news, and none of us can shrug off the nonstop bombardment of stories about conflict, corruption, crime, and human suffering without it taking a toll on our mood and our ability to focus.</p>
<p>Read the news weekly. Anything less frequent is likely to make you feel like you&#39;re out at sea, away from human civilisation. The important thing is to disconnect from the 24/7 breaking new cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Put Your Toys Away</strong></p>
<p>Close down everything once you&#39;ve finished working. Having previous day content popup before you start working can be a huge distraction. Instead opt for a clean, relaxing home wallpaper so when you&#39;re ready for work its a blissful experience.</p>
<p><strong>Fly Without Wi-Fi</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because you&#39;re literally buckled into a chair, I&#39;ve always found planes a terrific spot to do a lot of writing and reading and drawing and thinking - Austin Kleon</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Deal with Email at the End of the Day</strong></p>
<p>Use your prime hours to work on your Highlight and other important tasks. The little energy you have the end of the day can be used to do monotonous tasks such as clearing out your email.</p>
<p><strong>Be Slow to Respond</strong></p>
<p>Respond to email more slowly to make more time for Laser Mode, and if you&#39;re worried about coming off like a jerk, remind yourself that being focused and present will make you more valuable as a colleague and friend, not less.</p>
<p>Of course when you limit email time of increase response time, you may need to manage expectations of your colleagues and others. You could say at the bottom of your email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m slow to respond because I need to prioritise some important projects, but if your message is urgent, send me a text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Set Up Send-Only Email</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create an email account to be used for out-going email only. You can set it up anywhere, but using one of the popular webmail services makes it easier to add to your phone.</li>
<li>Setup email forwarding so that any replies will go to your normal account, leaving the new account empty.</li>
<li>Add the new account to your phone instead of your regular account.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shut the Door</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The closed door is your way of telling the world and yourself that you mean business - Stephen King</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your Highlight requires focused work, do yourself a favour and shut the door. If you don&#39;t have a room with a door, look for one you can camp out in for a few hours. And if you can&#39;t find one, put on headphones - even if you don&#39;t actually put on any music.</p>
<p><strong>Invent a Deadline</strong></p>
<p>Inventing deadlines are the secret ingredient in design sprints. The team schedules customer interviews on Friday so that starting Monday, everyone knows the clock is ticking. They have to solve their challenge and build a prototype before Thursday night.</p>
<p><strong>Play a Sound Track</strong></p>
<p>A cue is a trigger that causes you to act consciously or unconsciously. It&#39;s the first step in the &quot;habit loop&quot; Charles Duhigg describes in <em>The Power Of Habit</em>: First a cue prompts yuour brain to start the loop. The cue triggers you to perform a routine behaviour without thinking, on autopilot. Finally you get a reward: some result that makes your brain feel good and encourages it to run the same routine again the next time you encounter the cue.</p>
<p><strong>Start on Paper</strong></p>
<p>Paper is less intimidating. While most software is designed to guide you throughout a series of steps, paper allows you to find your own way to a cohesive idea.</p>
<p><strong>Meditate</strong></p>
<p>Reset your attention by paying attention to the physical sensations of a single breath:</p>
<ol>
<li>Breath in through the nose. Notice the air filling up your chest.</li>
<li>Breath out through the mouth. Notice your body softening.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Be Bored</strong></p>
<p>Boredom gives your mind a chance to wander, and wandering often leads you to interesting places. Test subjects were found to be better at creative problem solving than their non-bored peers.</p>
<p><strong>Take a Day Off</strong></p>
<p>Energy can fluctuate, and sometimes you need time to replenish it. Most of us can&#39;t take the day off work whenever we want, bit you can give yourself permission to take it easy. Switching to a joyful Highlight will help you recharge.</p>
<p><strong>Go All In</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The antidote to exhaustion is not necessarily rest... The antidote to exhaustion is wholeheartedness - Brother David Steindlrast</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wholeheartedness if a complete commitment, holding nothing back. It&#39;s letting go of caution and allowing yourself to care about your work, a relationship, a project, anything. Throwing yourself into the moment with enthusiasm and sincerity.</p>
<p>Sometimes if you go all in and embrace the current task with wild abandon, you may find it becomes easier to focus. You may find the energy is already there.</p>
<h4 id="energise-tactics">Energise Tactics</h4>
<p><strong>Exercise Every Day</strong></p>
<p>Exercise for about twenty minutes every day. Even if you aim to exercise 4/7 days a week and don&#39;t hit that goal, it’s fine. A good exercise to take up is walking. Walking can help you lose weight, strengthen bones, improve mood and thought clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Eat Better</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. - Michael Pollen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intermittent fasting provides benefits such as better cardiovascular fitness, longevity, muscle development and reduce risk of cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize Caffeine</strong></p>
<p>To the brain, caffeine molecules look a lot like a molecule called adenosine, whose job it is to tell the brain to slow down and feel sleepy or groggy. Caffeine binds to the receptors where the adenosine is supposed to go. Which causes the adenosine to float around up until the caffeine wears off and the excess adenosine is absorbed causing a caffeine crash.</p>
<p>A simple way to alleviate this is to have coffee at certain times:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wake up and start the day without any coffee.<ul>
<li>Cortisol is a hormone which helps you wake up and blocks caffeine from working. Cortisol is at its highest between 8am - 9am.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have your first cup 2 hours after waking up.</li>
<li>Have your last cup before 4pm.<ul>
<li>This is to help you sleep in the evening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expose yourself to nature</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When walking through nature, you’re freed from having to direct your attention, as there are few challenges to navigate (like street crossings), and experience enough interesting stimuli to keep your mind sufficiently occupied to avoid the need to actively aim your attention. This state allows your directed attention resources time to replenish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Meditation</strong></p>
<p>Meditation is just a breather for the brain. The act of slowing down and noticing your thoughts is exertion that leaves you invigorated, just as exercise does. Just like exercise, it can also help strengthen the brain making neurons stronger and thicker.</p>
<p><strong>Take a real break</strong></p>
<p>Gaze out of the window, go for a walk, grab a snack or talk to someone. Take your mind off current tasks or social media apps and enjoy the present, letting your mind take a rest from work.</p>
<p><strong>Be around your tribe</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Think of friends that give your energy</li>
<li>Go out of your way to have real conversations with them. Talk in person or on the phone, but your voice must be involved.</li>
<li>Feel refreshed and energised!</li>
</ol>
