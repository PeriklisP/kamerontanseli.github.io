<p>If you make your bed in the morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter.</p>
<p>If you can’t do the little things right, you will never do the big things right. And, if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made - that you made - and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.</p>
<p><em>If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.</em></p>
<p>In life you will face a lot of Circuses. You will pay for your failures. But, if you persevere, if you let those failures teach you and strengthen you, then you will be prepared to handle life’s toughest moments.</p>
<p>Life is a struggle and the potential for failure is ever present, but those who live in fear of failure, or hardship, or embarrassment will never achieve their potential. </p>
<p>Without pushing your limits, without occasionally sliding down the rope headfirst, without daring greatly, you will never know what is truly possible in your life.</p>
<p>In life, to achieve your goals, to complete the night swim, you will have to be men and women of great courage. That courage is within all of us. Dig deep, you will find it in abundance.</p>
<p>At some point we will all confront a dark moment in life. If not passing of a loved one, then something else that crusheds your spirit and leaves you wondering about your future. In that dark moment, reach deep within yourself and be your very best.</p>
<p><em>if you want to change the world, measure a person by the size of their heartm not the size of their flippers</em>.</p>
<p>Know that life is not fair and that you will fail often. But if you take some risks, setp up when times are toughest, face down the bullies, lif up the downtrodden, and never, ever give up - if you do these things, then you can change your life for the better… and maybe the world.</p>
<p>You can’t change the world alone - you will need some help - and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friendsm colleagues, the goodwill of strangers, and strong coxswain to guide them. </p>
<p><em>If you want to change the world, find someone to help you paddle</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes no matter how well you prepare or how well you perform you still end up as a sugar cookie. It’s just the way life is sometimes.</p>
<p><em>If you want to change the world, get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward</em>.</p>
