<h3 id="get-out-in-the-field">Get out in the field</h3>
<p>The class challenged them to design a baby incubator for 1% of the traditional $20k cost. In the developing world &quot;4m low-birthweight children die within the first 28 days because they don&#39;t have enough fat to regulate body temperature&quot;.</p>
<p>If they had raced into this as a cost problem, they would have produced an inexpensive electric incubator - a seemingly reasonable solution but one that, as it turned out, would have failed to address the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Instead they went to Nepal to see the challenge firsthand. They discovered 80% of babies were born at home, not in the hospital, in rural villages with no electricity. With this key insight they developed a waxlike substance that is heated by water and can heat the child for up to 6 hours.</p>
<h3 id="play">Play</h3>
<p>Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement, And it&#39;s the one thing that I believe we are jeopardising in the way we educate our children and ourselves.</p>
<p>Play, is anything we do simply for the joy of doing rather than as a means to an end. Play is essential, it has the power to improve everything from  personal health to relationships to education to organisations&#39; ability to innovate. Play leads to brain plasticity, adaptability, and creativity.</p>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>
<p>Sleep deprivation is similar to drinking too much alcohol, pulling all nighters or having a week of sleeping just 4-5 hours a night actually induces an impairment equivalent to a blood alcohol level of 0.1%.</p>
<p>A single cycle of REM enhanced the integration of unassociated information. Even a brief period of deep sleep. Helps us make the kinds of new connections that allow us to better learn from the world.</p>

<h3 id="select">Select</h3>
<p>It&#39;s either a HELL YEAH! Or No. The key is to put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we day yes. Anything less gets a thumbs down.</p>
<p>The 90% rule is one you can apply to any decision or dilemma. You simple give each option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it lower than 90, then automatically discard the option. This way you can avoid getting stuck with 60-70s.</p>
<p>The benefits of this approach to decision making should be clear: when our selection criteria is too broad, we find ourselves committing to too many options.</p>

        <th>Non-Essentialist</th>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <div>Says yes to almost every opportunity</div>
          <div>Uses broad, implicit criteria like "If someone I know is doing it, I should do it."</div>
        </td>
        <td>
          <div>Says yes to only the top 10% of opportunities</div>
          <div>Uses narrow, explicit criteria like "Is this exactly what I am looking for?"</div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>A simple systematic process you can use to apply selective criteria is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down the opportunity.</li>
<li>Write down a list of 3 minimum criteria, the options would need a pass in order to be considered.</li>
<li>Write down a list of three ideal or extreme criteria that the option would need to pass in order to be considered.</li>
<li>If it doesn&#39;t pass 2/3 of your extreme criteria, the answer is still no.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="uncommit">Uncommit</h3>
<p>Zero-based budgeting is to use zero as a baseline for your years budget. This eliminates any bias from profits from the pervious year. It draws attention to obsolete operations and encourages people to be more clear in their purpose and how their expenses align to projects</p>
<p>You can apply zero-based budgeting to your own endeavours. Instead of money try budgeting your time. Begin from scratch, asking which would you add today. You can do this with everything from the financial obligations you have to projects or even relationships you are in. Every use of time, energy or resources has to justify itself anew. If it no longer fits eliminate it altogether.</p>
<h3 id="edit">Edit</h3>
<p>The word decision in latin - cis or cid - literally means &quot;to cut&quot; or &quot;to kill&quot;. Making the choice to eliminate something good can be painful. But eventually, every cut produces joy - maybe not in the moment but afterwards, when we realise that every additional moment we gained can be spent on something better.</p>
