      <h3 id="lean-vs-agile-vs-design-thinking">Lean vs. Agile vs. Design Thinking</h3>
<p>Without a clear understanding of the customer, engineers focused on simply shipping features—the more, the better—without a sense of whether they helped to solve a real customer need in an effective way. And without any sense of the feasibility or strategic alignment of their prescribed solutions, designers came up with ideas that never stood a chance of seeing the light of day.</p>
<h4 id="agile">Agile</h4>
<p>The complexity of the service your team is building may prove to be far greater (or smaller) than anticipated. To deal with this uncertainty, the authors advocated working in short cycles and then pausing at the end of each cycle to reflect on accomplishments, learnings, new insights, and next steps.</p>
<p>Does the accumulated total of this data indicate we should continue in the same direction? If so, let’s work another short cycle in the same direction.</p>
<p>However, if the feedback we’ve collected over the last cycle (or “sprint”) indicates our current trajectory is flawed, we are obligated to change course—that is, to be agile.</p>
<h4 id="lean">Lean</h4>
<p>The determining factors for a decision are customer behaviours. Did we get an indication that our customers want this feature? Did they indicate they would pay for it? How do we know? What does that tell us? These are just a few of the questions Lean Startup methods help answer. And yet, again, ask those same anyones at large corporations if they’ve heard of Lean Startup, and they’ll say, “Yep, we’re building MVPs.” Sigh.</p>
<p>The MVP was designed as a tool of Lean Startup to help teams answer two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What’s the most important thing we need to learn first on our project?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What’s the least amount of work we need to do to learn that?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lean Startup has been largely the domain of product managers in large companies. It is typically their job to figure out what the teams work on and in what order. They’re responsible for figuring out the scope of each release and for shepherding the team to those outputs.</p>
<p>Since course correction is often frowned upon, any Lean Startup-style experimentation is often done up front, once, and then taken as “proof” that the team should execute the plan as written.</p>
<p>To combat the pushback on Lean Startup in the Enterprise, some companies have launched innovation labs. But What these labs don’t often have is a strategic mandate and a clear path for transitioning a product idea, once validated, into an integrated production track with the broader organisation.</p>
<h4 id="design-thinking">Design Thinking</h4>
<p>Design Thinking practices are there for teams to use continuously to ensure projects stay on track and are adjusting properly to the learning derived from our Agile practices. However, most teams, having failed to arrive at an epiphany during their first brainstorming session, rarely employ these practices throughout the lifecycle of the project.</p>
<p>The continuous nature of software, which should yield a cadence of continuous learning, is once again retrained on shipping bits to customers without the benefit of team-wide shared understanding of the core customer need.</p>
<h4 id="integrating-a-process">Integrating a process</h4>
<h5 id="work-in-short-cycles">Work in short cycles</h5>
<p>Take small steps. Pick a new idea or practice and try it with a subset of your teams. This new practice shouldn’t be handed down as a permanent change. Instead, present it as a “process experiment.” Let the team try it for a limited amount of time (e.g., two sprints) and see how it works. If it fails, the team has invested very little time and effort in this change, but (hopefully) they’ve learned a lot. If it succeeds, the team keeps the practice, improves on it, and the organisation rolls it out to more teams.</p>
<p>here’s a small experiment to run with your team to increase their amount of customer exposure (a value lauded by Agile, Lean, and Design Thinking): Every two sprints, the entire team goes out, together, to observe customers using your product for a half day. The specifics of the outing—whether simple observation, planned usability test, or customer interviews—are largely irrelevant. The goal is to get members of the team who don’t normally come into contact with customers to do so on a regular basis.</p>
<h5 id="hold-regular-retrospectives">Hold regular retrospectives</h5>
<p>Retrospectives are the heart of continuous improvement. They are a regular opportunity for the team to consider their current practice, evaluate its efficacy, and determine how to progress. Many teams who claim to practice Agile don’t hold regular retrospectives.</p>
<p>Initial retros are uncomfortable and often feel like nothing more than venting sessions. Even teams who hold these sessions regularly often generate so much improvement material that it feels like very little is actually getting better.</p>
<p>At the end of each sprint, encourage your teams to get together for an hour, review what worked well during that cycle, what didn’t go well, and commit to improving one or two key things each time.</p>
<h5 id="put-the-customer-at-the-centre-of-everything">Put the customer at the centre of everything</h5>
<p>The customer is the person who has to use the product. It’s really as simple as that. Without customers, there is no business. There is no team. There is no product. Agile, Lean, and Design Thinking prominently tout the supremacy of the customer in all activities. Yet, each methodology offers a different definition of who the actual customer is.</p>
<p>While Lean and Design Thinking generally align on “the person buying and using the product” as the customer, Agile often refers to product owners or “the business” as the customers. If they’re not using the product, they’re not the customer.</p>
<p>Consider asking the following questions on a regular basis:</p>
<p><em>How do we know we’re shipping something users care about?</em></p>
<p>This question will quickly reveal whether or not your teams have a good feedback loop with their customers. If you don’t know whether your customers value what you’re shipping, you’ve identified a critical gap in your understanding of your work.</p>
<p><em>How do we find out?</em></p>
<p>This question addresses the customer feedback gap identified in the previous question. Do you need to go out into the field to meet customers? Do you need to implement an analytics system? Is there a conference you can go to where your customers regularly congregate?</p>
<p><em>How does that affect what we prioritise?</em></p>
<p>Once the feedback loop is in place, the team will need a method for incorporating it into their decision making process in a timely fashion. Holding regular customer development sessions, as well a bringing these findings into your iteration planning meetings, is a good place to start.</p>
<h5 id="go-and-see">Go and see</h5>
<p>Get managers out of the offices and onto the manufacturing floors to see how the teams were working.</p>
<p>As a manager, it&#39;s your job to regularly walk around, talk to your teams, and ask them what&#39;s working and where they&#39;re struggling.</p>
<p>Bring those learnings back to your management meetings and share with your colleagues.</p>
<p>Do not shun successful practises simply because they don&#39;t fit neatly into one of those predefined recipes.</p>
<h5 id="balance-product-discovery-with-delivery-work-by-only-testing-high-risk-hypotheses">Balance product discovery with delivery work by only testing high-risk hypotheses</h5>
<p>Product discovery work is perceived as a block to shopping code. <em>&quot;Oh great, another brain storming session.&quot;, &quot;How long do we have to wait until the research is done?&quot;, &quot;Why do we have to test everything?&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>This perception is exacerbated when each discipline on the team wants to practise &quot;their flavour&quot; of product discovery.</p>
<p>The reality is, teams can&#39;t test every task in their backlog. In fact, they shouldn&#39;t. There are assumptions in every backlog that are riskier than others. Prioritise these assumptions based on their perceived risk and their perceived value. Everyone on the team should weigh in on risk, because each backlog item may present a different type of risk.</p>
<p>The items that qualify as high risk and high value are the only ones that should be subjected to product discovery efforts.</p>
<p>Determine what the most important thing you need to learn from this, and then leverage the most appropriate discovery technique to learn that.</p>
<h5 id="do-less-research-more-often">Do less research, more often</h5>
<p>User research traditionally required at least two days offsite. In a facility stocked with candy, a dozen test participants, and a broad array of team members checking in and out as their calendars dictated.</p>
<p>With a competent moderator and reasonable testing script, almost every major issue was revealed within the first five test participants.</p>
<p>To avoid lost time, continue to practice user research with a cross-functional team in attendance, but simply do less of it, more often.</p>
<p>Instead of testing 12 people, test 3. Take the learning from that, and then test again the next week. Don&#39;t go offsite. Work in the office to ensure maximum participation. Most importantly, broadcast your findings immediately after the test. Show the value of the exercise, reduce the commitment for participation, as well as the cost, and you&#39;ll find an increased level of organisation buy-in.</p>
<h5 id="work-train-as-one-balanced-team">Work/Train as one balanced team</h5>
<p>Traditionally teams work in silos, handing work to other divisions/silos. Each silo consists of their own work discipline. Due to this, they do not work together on the same thing at the same time.</p>
<p>This is waterfall development with Agile language (some call it &quot;AgileFall&quot;) and we&#39;ve been actively moving away from it for years.</p>
<p>To combat this tendency, reconsider how you staff projects. The atomic unit of planning for any project is the team. The team is made up of designers, software engineers, and product managers at the very least. There is no &quot;engineering team&quot; or &quot;design team&quot; at the project level.</p>
<h5 id="radical-transparency">Radical transparency</h5>
<p>Some members of your team will have experience with Agile. Others will be experts in Lean Startup, and yet others may have gone to Design Thinking course.</p>
<p>When approached with a new way of working people struggle. As new processes roll out, ensure that it&#39;s clear why you&#39;re trying something new. Let people see how the process plays out with other teams. Hold open retrospectives so that others can get a sense of where a new process, like Agile or Lean, struggles in the company.</p>
<p>Be clear about what success looks like, make sure everyone is aligned to that criteria, and identify how you&#39;ll measure it. If certain aspects of a process don&#39;t fit with your organisation, be clear about why you&#39;re abandoning them and what you&#39;ll do instead.</p>
<p>Post success metrics around the office, show current progress being made against those metrics. This can be done with real-time monitors showing data or, as one of my tams once did, you can print out the state of every metric every day you walk in the office. Indicate how it changes from yesterday and post copies of it all over the office.</p>
<h5 id="review-your-incentive-structure-and-performance-management-criteria-">Review your incentive structure (and performance management criteria)</h5>
<p>Teams will optimise the work they&#39;re incentivised to achieve. If you incentivise velocity, teams will work on getting more features out to market. If you incentivise learning, teams will build better product discovery processes.</p>
<p>If you want to build collaboration and learning, employees must be assessed on the efficacy of their collaboration and their ability to build continuous learning into their work.</p>
<h5 id="make-product-discovery-work-a-first-class-citizen-of-your-backlog">Make product discovery work a first-class citizen of your backlog</h5>
<p>One symptom that seems to manifest consistently across organisations is that work that gets visualised is the work that gets donee.</p>
<p>Agile, particularly, has very clear directions, ceremonies, and rituals around visualising work. This is why most companies practice agile. You will see physical boards or monitors displaying the team&#39;s work in JIRA or other digital project management tools.</p>
<p>Yet there is no clear process or ritual linked to visualising learning work. The valuable activities of Learn Startup and Design Thinking rarely find their way into the same tools as the Agile activities. The result of this is that work doesn&#39;t get treated the same way as delivery work. It marginalises the effort and allows it to be cut in the event of a time or scope crunch.</p>
<p>To avoid this, product discovery must become a first-class citizen of the backlog. It must be visualised along with the delivery tasks. It must be prioritised against them and assigned to specific members of the team.</p>
<h4 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h4>
<p>At the end of the day, your customers don&#39;t care whether you practice Agile, Lean or Design Thinking. They care about great products and services that solve meaningful problems in effective ways.</p>
<p>The more you focus your teams on satisfying customer needs, collaborating to create compelling experiences and incentivising them to continuously improve. It won&#39;t matter which methodology they employ. Their process will simply be better.</p>
