      <h3 id="letters-from-a-stoic">Letters From a Stoic</h3>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man&#39;s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.</p>
<p>You should be extending your stay among writers whose genius is unquestionable, deriving constant nourishment from them if you wish to gain anything from your reading that will find a lasting place in your mind.</p>
<p>People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but no real friendships.</p>
<p>The same must needs be the case with people who never set about acquiring an intimate acquaintanceship with any one great writer, but skip from one to another, paying flying visits to them all.</p>
<p>Nothing is so useful that it can be of any service in the mere passing. A multitude of books only gets in one&#39;s way</p>
<p>So if you are unable to read all the books in your possession, you have enough when you have all the books you are able to read.</p>
<p>If at any moment you find yourself wanting a change from a particular author, go back to ones you have read before</p>
<p>But whatever you do, return from body to mind very soon. Exercise it day and night. Only a moderate amount of work is needed for it to thrive and develop. It is a form of exercise to which cold and heat and even old age are no obstacle. <strong>Cultivate an asset which the passing of time itself improves.</strong></p>
<p>We need to set our affections on some good man and keep him constantly before our eyes, so that <strong>we may live as if he were watching us and do everything as if he saw what we were doing.</strong></p>
<p>Misdeeds are greatly diminished if a witness is always standing near intending doers.</p>
<p><strong>Happy the man who improves other people not merely when he is in their presence but even when he is in their thoughts</strong>! And happy, too, is the person who can so revere another as to adjust and shape his own personality in the light of recollections, even, of that other. <strong>A person able to revere another thus will soon deserve to be revered himself.</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m not telling you to be always bent over book or writing-tablets. <strong>The mind has to be given some time off, but in such a way that it may be refreshed</strong>, not relaxed till it goes to pieces.</p>
<p>Carry out a searching analysis and close scrutiny of yourself in all sorts of different lights. Consider above all else whether you&#39;ve advanced in philosophy or just in actual years.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy is not an occupation of a popular nature, nor is it pursued for the sake of self-advertisement.</strong> Its concern is not with words, but with facts. It is not carried on with the object of passing the day in an entertaining sort of way and taking the boredom out of leisure. It moulds and builds the personality, orders one&#39;s life, regulates one&#39;s conduct, shows one what one should do and what one should leave undone, sits at the helm, and keeps one on the correct course as one is tossed about in perilous seas. Without it no one can lead a life free of fear or worry. <strong>Every hour of the day countless situations arise that call for advice, and for that advice we have to look to philosophy.</strong></p>
<h4 id="friends">Friends</h4>
<p>Certainly you should discuss everything with a friend; but before you do so, discuss in your mind the man himself. <strong>After friendship is formed you must trust</strong>, but before that you must judge.</p>
<p>Think for a long time whether or not you should admit a given person to your friendship. But when you have decided to do so, welcome him heart and soul, and speak as unreservedly with him as you would with yourself. You should, I need hardly say, <strong>live in such a way that there is nothing which you could not as easily tell your enemy as keep to yourself</strong>;</p>
<p>Regard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal. <strong>Some men&#39;s fear of being deceived has taught people to deceive them</strong>; by their suspiciousness they give them the right to do the wrong thing by them. </p>
<p>Trusting everyone is as much a fault as trusting no one (though I should call the first the worthier and the second the safer behaviour).</p>
<p>The active man should be able to take things easily, while the man who is inclined towards repose should be capable of action. Ask nature: she will tell you that she made both day and night.</p>
<p><strong>Great pleasure is to be found not only in keeping up an old and established friendship but also in beginning and building up a new one.</strong> There is the same difference between having gained a friend and actually gaining a friend as there is between a farmer harvesting and a farmer sowing.</p>
<p>These are what are commonly called fair-weather friendships. <strong>A person adopted as a friend for the sake of his usefulness will be cultivated only for so long as he is useful.</strong></p>
<p>To have someone to be able to die for, someone I may follow into exile, someone for whose life I may put myself up as security and pay the price as well.</p>
<p>Actual love in itself, heedless of all other considerations, inflames peoples hearts with a passion for the beautiful object, not without the hope, too, that the affection will be mutual.</p>
<p>In the same way as he would any object of great beauty, not drawn by gain, not out of alarm at the vicissitudes of fortune. <strong>To procure friendship only for better and not for worse is to rob it of all its dignity.</strong></p>
<h4 id="teaching">Teaching</h4>
<p>Refrain from following the example of those whose craving is for attention, not their own improvement.</p>
<p>Avoid shabby attire, long hair, an unkempt beard, an outspoken dislike of silverware, sleeping on the ground and all other misguided means to self-advertisement. The very name of philosophy, however modest the manner in which it is pursued, is unpopular enough as it is: imagine what the reaction would be if we started dissociating ourselves from the conventions of society.</p>
<p>Our clothes should not be gaudy, yet they should not be dowdy either. We should not keep silver plate with inlays of solid gold, but at the same time we should not imagine that doing without gold and silver is proof that we are leading the simple life.</p>
<p><strong>Let our aim be a way of life not diametrically opposed to, but better than that of the mob</strong>. Otherwise we shall repel and alienate the very people whose reform we desire;</p>
<p>Our motto, as everyone knows, is to live in conformity with nature: it is quite contrary to nature to torture one&#39;s body, to reject simple standards of cleanliness and make a point of being dirty, to adopt a diet that is not just plain but hideous and revolting.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy calls for simple living, not for doing penance.</strong></p>
<p>People should admire our way of life but they should at the same time find it understandable.</p>
<p>If wisdom were offered me on the one condition that I should keep it shut away and not divulge it to anyone, I should reject it. <strong>There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with.</strong></p>
<p>You should really be here and on the spot, firstly because people believe their eyes rather more than their ears.</p>
<p><strong>No one is really capable of understanding you.</strong> You might perhaps come across one here and there, but even <strong>they would need to be trained and developed by you to a point where they could grasp your teaching.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Things of greatest merit are common property</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="being-present">Being Present</h4>
<p><strong>Limiting one&#39;s desires actually helps to cure one of fear</strong>. Cease to hope, he says, and you will cease to fear.</p>
<p>Fear keeps pace with hope. Nor does their so moving together surprise me; both belong to a mind in suspense, to <strong>a mind in a state of anxiety through looking into the future</strong>. Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead of us instead of adapting ourselves to the present. <strong>Thus it is that foresight, the greatest blessing humanity has been given, is transformed into a curse.</strong> </p>
<p>A number of our blessings do us harm, for memory brings back the agony of fear while foresight brings it on prematurely. <strong>No one confines his unhappiness to the present.</strong></p>
<p>Set yourself a limit which you couldn&#39;t even exceed if you wanted to, and say good-bye at last to those deceptive prizes more precious to those who hope for them than to those who have won them. If there were anything substantial in them they would sooner or later bring a sense of fullness; as it is <strong>they simply aggravate the thirst of those who swallow them.</strong></p>
<p>It is impossible either to change what is already determined or to make preparations to meet what is undetermined;</p>
<p>I advise and urge you not to allow your spiritual enthusiasm to cool off or fall away. Keep a hold on it and put it on a firm footing, so that what is at present an enthusiasm may become a settled spiritual disposition.</p>
<h4 id="scorn-the-majority-s-approval">Scorn the Majority&#39;s Approval</h4>
<p>Those which spring from false opinions have nowhere to stop, for falsity has no point of termination. </p>
<p>Whenever you want to know whether the desire aroused in you by something you are pursuing is natural or quite unseeing, ask yourself whether it is capable of coming to rest at any point; if after going a long way there is always something remaining farther away, be sure it is not something natural.</p>
<p>If you shape your life according to nature, you will never be poor; if according to people&#39;s opinions, you will never be rich.</p>
<p>Associating with people in large numbers is actually harmful: there is not one of them that will not make some vice or other attractive to us, or leave us carrying the imprint of it or bedaubed all unawares with it.</p>
<p>But nothing is as ruinous to the character as sitting away one&#39;s time at a show. <strong>Through the medium of entertainment, that vices creep into one with more than usual ease.</strong></p>
<p>Bad examples have a way of recoiling on those who set them? Give thanks to the immortal gods that the men to whom you are giving a lesson in cruelty are not in a position to profit from it.</p>
<p><strong>When a mind is impressionable and has none too firm a hold on what is right, it must be rescued from the crowd:</strong> it is so easy for it to go over to the majority.</p>
<p>An intimate who leads a pampered life gradually makes one soft and flabby; a wealthy neighbour provokes cravings in one; a companion with a malicious nature tends to rub off some of his rust even on someone of an innocent and open-hearted nature – what then do you imagine the effect on a person&#39;s character is when the assault comes from the world at large? You must inevitably either hate or imitate the world. But the right thing is to shun both courses: <strong>you should neither become like the bad because they are many, nor be an enemy of the many because they are unlike you.</strong> Retire into yourself as much as you can. <strong>Associate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those whom you are capable of improving.</strong></p>
<p>Scorn the pleasure that comes from the majority&#39;s approval. The many speak highly of you, but <strong>have you really any grounds for satisfaction with yourself if you are the kind of person the many understand?</strong> Your merits should not be outward facing.</p>
<p>So <strong>continually remind yourself, Lucilius, of the many things you have achieved. When you look at all the people out in front of you, think of all the ones behind you.</strong> If you want to feel appreciative where the gods and your life are concerned, just think how many people you&#39;ve outdone. <strong>Why be concerned about others, come to that, when you&#39;ve outdone your own self?</strong> </p>
<h4 id="fortune">Fortune</h4>
<p>With me no day is ever whiled away at ease. I claim a good part of my nights for study; I have no time for sleep: I just succumb to it, keeping my eyes at their work when they are heavy-lidded and exhausted from lack of rest. I have withdrawn from affairs as well as from society, and from my own affairs in particular: <strong>I am acting on behalf of later generations.</strong></p>
<p>Fortune does not just capsize the boat: she hurls it headlong on the rocks and dashes it to pieces.</p>
<p>Avoid, I cry, whatever is approved of by the mob, and things that are the gift of chance. <strong>Whenever circumstance brings some welcome thing your way, stop in suspicion and alarm</strong>: wild animals and fish alike are taken in by this or that inviting prospect. Do you look on them as presents given you by fortune? They are snares. Anyone among you who wishes to lead a secure life will do his very best to steer well wide of these baited bounties, which comprise yet another instance of the errors we miserable creatures fall into: <strong>we think these things are ours when in fact it is we who are caught.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Indulge the body just so far as suffices for good health. It needs to be treated somewhat strictly to prevent it from being disobedient to the spirit.</strong> Your food should appease your hunger, your drink quench your thirst, your clothing keep out the cold, your house be a protection against inclement weather.</p>
<p><strong>What you have to understand is that thatch makes a person just as good a roof as gold does.</strong> Spurn everything that is added on by way of decoration and display by unnecessary labour. Reflect that <strong>nothing merits admiration except the spirit, the impressiveness of which prevents it from being impressed by anything</strong>.</p>
<p>Nature&#39;s wants are small, while those of opinion are limitless. Imagine that you&#39;ve piled, up all that a veritable host of rich men ever possessed, that fortune has carried you far beyond the bounds of wealth so far as any private individual is concerned, building you a roof of gold and clothing you in royal purple, conducting you to such a height of opulence and luxury that you hide the earth with marble floors – putting you in a position not merely to own, but to walk all over treasures – throw in sculptures, paintings, all that has been produced at tremendous pains by all the arts to satisfy extravagance: <strong>all these things will only induce in you a craving for even bigger things.</strong></p>
<p>Anyone entering our homes should admire us rather than our furnishings. It is a great man that can treat his earthenware as if it was silver, and a man who treats his silver as if it was earthenware is no less great.</p>
<p>To live under constraint is a misfortune, but there is no constraint to live under constraint.</p>
<p>You ask what is the proper limit to a person&#39;s wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough.</p>
<h4 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h4>
<p><strong>The wise man needs hands and eyes and a great number of things that are required for the purposes of day-to-day life; but he lacks nothing</strong>, for <strong>lacking something implies that it is a necessity and nothing</strong>, to the wise man, is a necessity. Self-contented as he is, then, he does need friends – and wants as many of them as possible – but not to enable him to lead a happy life; this he will have even without friends.</p>
<p>Finding repose in himself, absorbed in his own thoughts. Such is more or less the way of the wise man: <strong>he retires to his inner self, is his own company.</strong></p>
<p>The wise man, nevertheless, unequalled though he is in his devotion to his friends, though regarding them as being no less important and frequently more important than his own self, will still consider what is valuable in life to be something wholly confined to his inner self.</p>
<p>He made Demetrius wonder whether he had won a victory after all. &quot;All my possessions&quot; he said, are with me, meaning by this the qualities of a just, a good and an enlightened character, and indeed the very fact of not regarding as valuable anything that is capable of being taken away.</p>
<p>The point being that we should be ruled not by the actual words used but by the sense of them.</p>
<p><strong>Not happy he who thinks himself not so</strong>. What difference does it make, after all, what your position in life is if you dislike it yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Only the wise man is content with what is his. All foolishness suffers the burden of dissatisfaction with itself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For no amount of wisdom enables one to do away with physical or mental weaknesses that arise from natural causes</strong>; anything inborn or ingrained in one can by dint of practice be allayed, but not overcome.</p>
<p>Nature just wields her power and uses the particular weakness to make even the strongest conscious of her. </p>
<p>Our wise man feels his troubles but overcomes them, while their wise man does not even feel them. <strong>We share with them the belief that the wise man is content with himself. Nevertheless, self-sufficient though he is, he still desires a friend</strong>, a neighbour, a companion. Notice how self-contented he is: on occasion such a man is content with a mere partial self – if he loses a hand as a result of war or disease, or has one of his eyes, or even both, put out in an accident, he will be satisfied with what remains of himself and be no less pleased with his body now that it is maimed and incomplete than he was when it was whole.</p>
<p>What progress have I made? <strong>I am beginning to be my own friend. That is progress indeed. Such a person will never be alone</strong>, and you may be sure he is a friend of all.</p>
<h4 id="death">Death</h4>
<p>Well, <strong>we should cherish old age and enjoy it. It is full of pleasure if you know how to use it.</strong> Fruit tastes most delicious just when its season is ending. The charms of youth are at their greatest at the time of its passing. </p>
<p><strong>It is the final glass which pleases the inveterate drinker, the one that sets the crowning touch on his intoxication and sends him off into oblivion.</strong> Every pleasure defers till its last its greatest delights. </p>
<p><strong>Death ought to be right there before the eyes of a young man just as much as an old one</strong> – the order in which we each receive our summons is not determined by our precedence in the register.</p>
<p>What he did from discreditable motives we should do from honourable ones, <strong>saying in all joyfulness and cheerfulness as we retire to our beds, I have lived; I have completed now the course.</strong></p>
