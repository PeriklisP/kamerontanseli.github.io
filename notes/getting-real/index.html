<h2 id="build-software-for-yourself">Build software for yourself</h2>
<p>You’ll know what’s important and what’s not</p>
<p><em>When you write a book, you need to have more than an interesting story. You need to have a desire to tell the story.  *  Malcolm Gladwell, author</em></p>
<h2 id="don-t-take-vc-investment">Don’t take VC investment</h2>
<p>Run on limited resources and you’ll be forced to reckon with constraints earlier and more intensely. And that’s a good thing. Constraints drive innovation.</p>
<h2 id="launch-on-time-and-on-budget">Launch on time and on budget</h2>
<p>Do not throw more money or time at the problem instead pair down the scope of the task at hand</p>
<p>There’s always time to add stuff later – later is eternal, now is fleeting.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h2>
<p>Prioritisation is deciding what is really important.</p>
<p>Reality is setting expectations that deliver high quality.</p>
<p>Flexibility is making half a product than a half-assed product</p>
<h2 id="have-an-enemy">Have an enemy</h2>
<p>Sometimes the best way to know what your app should be is to know what it shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>One bonus you get from having an enemy is a very clear marketing message. People are stoked by conflict. And they also understand a product by comparing it to others. With a chosen enemy, you’re feeding people a story they want to hear.</p>
<p>It’s also important to not get too obsessed with the competition. Over analyse other products and you’ll start to limit the way you think. Take a look and then move on to your own vision and your own ideas.</p>
<p><em>The problem is that once a consumer has bought someone else’s story and believes that lie, persuading the consumer to switch is the same as persuading him to admit he was wrong. And people hate admitting that they’re wrong. Instead, you must tell a different story and persuade listeners that your story is more important than the story they currently believe. If your competition is faster, you must be cheaper. - Seth Godin</em></p>
<h2 id="it-shouldn-t-be-a-chore">It Shouldn’t be a Chore</h2>
<p>The less your app is a chore to build, the better it will be.</p>
<p>Keep it small and manageable so you can actually enjoy the process.</p>
<p>If your app doesn’t excite you, something’s wrong. If you’re only working on it in order to cash out, it will show.</p>
<h2 id="lean-mass">Lean Mass</h2>
<p>The leaner you are, the easier it is to change</p>
<p>You become bigger by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long term contracts</li>
<li>Excess staff</li>
<li>Permanent decisions</li>
<li>Meetings about other meetings</li>
<li>Thick process</li>
<li>Inventory (physical or mental)</li>
<li>Hardware, software, technology lock-ins</li>
<li>Proprietary data formats</li>
<li>The past ruling the future</li>
<li>Long-term roadmaps</li>
<li>Office politics</li>
</ul>
<p>You become leaner by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just-in-time thinking</li>
<li>Multi-tasking team members</li>
<li>Embracing constraints, not trying to lift them</li>
<li>Less software, less code</li>
<li>Less features</li>
<li>Small team size</li>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Pared-down interfaces</li>
<li>Open-source products</li>
<li>Open data formats</li>
<li>An open culture that makes it easy to admit mistakes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lower-the-cost-of-change">Lower the cost of change</h2>
<p>Stay flexible by reducing obstacles to change
Keep it small.</p>
<p>Keep it simple. Let it happen.</p>
<p>Many common software development practices have the unfortunate sideeffect of eliminating any chance for emergent behaviour.</p>
<p>Most attempts at optimisation, tying something down very explicitly, reduces the breadth and scope of interactions and relationships, which is the very source of emergence.</p>
<p>It’s the interactions and relationships that create the interesting behaviour.</p>
<p>The harder we tighten things down, the less room there is for a creative, emergent solution. Whether it’s locking down requirements before they are well understood or prematurely optimising code, or inventing complex navigation and workflow scenarios before letting end users play with the system, the result is the same: an overly complicated, stupid system instead of a clean, elegant system that harnesses emergence.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-musketeers">The Three Musketeers</h2>
<p>Use a team of three for version 1.0</p>
<p>Start with a developer, a designer, and a sweeper (someone who can roam between both worlds).</p>
<p>Your lack of manpower means you’ll be forced to deal with tradeoffs earlier in the process – and that’s alright. It will make you figure out your priorities earlier rather than later.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to communicate without constantly having to worry about leaving people out of the loop.</p>
<p>Keep the team as small as possible. Metcalfe’s Law, that <em>“the value of a communication system grows at approximately the square of the number of users of the system,”</em> has a corollary when it comes to project teams.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-constraints">Embrace constraints</h2>
<p>Let limitations guide you to creative solutions</p>
<p>Constraints are often advantages in disguise. Forget about venture capital, long release cycles, and quick hires. Instead, work with what you have.</p>
<h2 id="be-yourself">Be Yourself</h2>
<p>Differentiate yourself from bigger companies by being personal and friendly</p>
<p>Being small means you can talk <em>with</em> your customers, not down to them.</p>
<p>Your site and your product can have a human voice instead of sounding like a corporate drone.</p>
<p>There are also advantages to internal communications at small companies too. You can ditch formalities. There’s no need for arduous processes and multiple sign-offs on everything. Everyone in the process can speak openly and honestly.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-big-idea-">What’s the big idea?</h2>
<p>Explicitly define the one-point vision for your app</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basecamp: Project management is communication</p>
</li>
<li><p>Backpack: Bring life’s loose ends together</p>
</li>
<li><p>Campfire: Group chat over IM sucks</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ta-da List: Competing with a post-it note</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whiteboard: Word is overkill</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Organisations need guideposts. They need an outline; employees need to know each day when they wake up why they’re going to work.</p>
<h2 id="work-from-large-to-small">Work from large to small</h2>
<p>Success isn’t the only thing you’ll find in the details. You’ll also find stagnation, disagreement, meetings, and delays. These things can kill morale and lower your chances of success.</p>
<p>Details reveal themselves as you use what you’re building. You’ll see what needs more attention. You’ll feel what’s missing. You’ll know which potholes to pave over because you’ll keep hitting them.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-a-problem-when-its-a-problem">It’s a problem when its a problem</h2>
<p>Don’t waste time on problems you don’t have yet</p>
<p>Make decisions just in time, when you have access to the real information you need. In the meanwhile, you’ll be able to lavish attention on the things that require immediate care.</p>
<h2 id="hire-the-right-customers">Hire the Right Customers</h2>
<p>Find the core market for your application and focus solely on them</p>
<p>The customer is not always right. The truth is you have to sort out who’s right and who’s wrong for your app.</p>
<p>If you try to please everyone, you won’t please anyone</p>
<h2 id="scale-later">Scale later</h2>
<p>You don’t have a scaling problem yet</p>
<p>Create a great app and then worry about what to do once it’s wildly successful.</p>
<h2 id="make-opinionated-software">Make Opinionated Software</h2>
<p>Your app should take sides</p>
<p>The best software has a vision. The best software takes sides. When someone uses software, they’re not just looking for features, they’re looking for an approach. They’re looking for a vision. Decide what your vision is and run with it.</p>
<p>Remember, if they don’t like your vision there are plenty of other visions out there for people. Don’t go chasing people you’ll never make happy.</p>
<h2 id="half-not-half-assed">Half, Not Half-Assed</h2>
<p>Build half a product, not a half-ass product</p>
<p>Stick to what’s truly essential. Good ideas can be tabled. Take whatever you think your product should be and cut it in half.</p>
<p>Pare features down until you’re left with only the most essential ones. Then do it again.</p>
<h2 id="it-just-doesn-t-matter">It Just Doesn’t Matter</h2>
<p>Our favourite answer to the “why didn’t you do this or why didn’t you do that?” question is always: “Because it just doesn’t matter.” That statement embodies what makes a product great. Figuring out what matters and leaving out the rest.</p>
<p>Most of the time you spend is wasted on things that just don’t matter. If you can cut out the work and thinking that just don’t matter, you’ll achieve productivity you’ve never imagined.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-no">Start With No</h2>
<p>Make features work hard to be implemented</p>
<p>Make each feature prove itself and show that it’s a survivor. It’s like “Fight Club.” You should only consider features if they’re willing to stand on the porch for three days waiting to be let in.</p>
<p>Each time you say yes to a feature, you’re adopting a child. You have to take your baby through a whole chain of events (e.g. design, implementation, testing, etc.). And once that feature’s out there, you’re stuck with it. Just try to take a released feature away from customers and see how pissed off they get.</p>
<p>If a request for a feature keeps coming back, that’s when we know it’s time to take a deeper look. Then, and only then, do we start considering the feature for real.</p>
<h2 id="hidden-costs">Hidden Costs</h2>
<p>Expose the price of new features</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for feature loops (i.e. features that lead to more features).</p>
<p>For every new feature you need to...</p>
<ul>
<li>Say no.</li>
<li>Force the feature to prove its value.</li>
<li>If “no” again, end here. If “yes,” continue...</li>
<li>Sketch the screen(s)/ui.</li>
<li>Design the screen(s)/ui.</li>
<li>Code it.</li>
<li>Test, tweak, test, tweak, test, tweak, test, tweak... 16. Check to see if help text needs to be modified.</li>
<li>Update the product tour (if necessary).</li>
<li>Update the marketing copy (if necessary).</li>
<li>Update the terms of service (if necessary).</li>
<li>Check to see if any promises were broken.</li>
<li>Check to see if pricing structure is affected.</li>
<li>Launch.</li>
<li>Hold breath.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-you-handle-it-">Can you handle it?</h2>
<p>Build products and offer services you can manage. It’s easy to make promises. It’s much harder to keep them.</p>
<p>Make sure whatever it is that you’re doing is something you can actually sustain – organisationally, strategically, and financially.</p>
<h2 id="human-solutions">Human Solutions</h2>
<p>Build software for general concepts and encourage people to create their own solutions</p>
<p>Don’t force conventions on people. Instead make your software general so everyone can find their own solution. Give people just enough to solve their own problems their own way. And then get out of the way.</p>
<p>Do the best job you can with the root of the problem then step aside. People will find their own solutions and conventions within your general framework.</p>
<h2 id="forget-feature-requests">Forget Feature Requests</h2>
<p>Let your customers remind you what’s important</p>
<p>Don’t worry about tracking and saving each request that comes in. Let your customers be your memory. If it’s really worth remembering, they’ll remind you until you can’t forget.</p>
<p>Just because x number of people request something, doesn’t mean you <em>have</em> to include it. Sometimes it’s better to just say no and maintain your vision for the product.</p>
<h2 id="hold-the-mayo">Hold the Mayo</h2>
<p>Ask people what they don’t want</p>
<p>More isn’t the answer. Sometimes the biggest favour you can do for customers is to leave something out.</p>
<h2 id="race-to-running-software">Race to Running Software</h2>
<p>Get something real up and running quickly</p>
<p>Real things lead to real reactions. And that’s how you get to the truth.</p>
<p>Stories, wireframes, even html mockups, are just approximations. Running software is real.</p>
<p>With real, running software everyone gets closer to true understanding and agreement. You avoid heated arguments over sketches and paragraphs that wind up turning out not to matter anyway. You realise that parts you thought we’re trivial are actually quite crucial.</p>
<p><em>When there is a working implementation of a key component available, developers want to understand how it will or won’t work with their piece of the application and will generally try to use it as soon as they can. Even if the implementation isn’t perfect or complete at first, this early collaboration usually leads to well-defined interfaces and features that do exactly what they need to. - Matt Hamer, developer and product manager, Kinja</em></p>
<h2 id="rinse-and-repeat">Rinse and Repeat</h2>
<p>Work in iterations</p>
<p>Instead of banking on getting everything right upfront, the iterative process lets you continue to make informed decisions as you go along.</p>
<p>The result is real feedback and real guidance on what requires your attention.</p>
<p>Knowing that you’re going to revisit issues is a great motivator to just get ideas out there to see if they’ll fly.</p>
<h2 id="from-idea-to-implementation">From Idea to Implementation</h2>
<p>Go from brainstorm to sketches to HTML to coding</p>
<p>Brainstorm</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the product/feature going to do?</li>
<li>What does the app need to do?</li>
<li>How will we know when it’s useful?</li>
<li>What exactly are we going to make?</li>
</ul>
<p>Paper Sketches</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and dirty</li>
<li>The goal at this point should be to convert concepts into rough interface designs. This step is all about experimentation. There are no wrong answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML Screens</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an html version of that feature (or section or flow, if it’s more appropriate). Get something real posted so everyone can see what it looks like on screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code</p>
<ul>
<li>When the mock-up looks good and demonstrates enough of the necessary functionality, go ahead and plug in the programming code.</li>
<li>You should feel free to throw away the deliverable of any particular step and start again if it turns out crappy. It’s natural to go through this cycle multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="avoid-preferences">Avoid Preferences</h2>
<p>Decide the little details so your customers don’t have to.</p>
<p>Preference settings are a way to avoid making tough decisions</p>
<p>Instead of using your expertise to choose the best path, you’re leaving it in the hands of customers.</p>
<p>You might make a bad call. But so what. If you do, people will complain and tell you about it. As always, you can adjust. Getting Real is all about being able to change on the fly.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done</h2>
<p>Decisions are temporary so make the call and move on</p>
<p>But wait, what if you screw up and make the wrong call? It’s ok. This isn’t brain surgery, it’s a web app. As we keep saying, you’ll likely have to revisit features and ideas multiple times during the process anyway.</p>
<p>Accept that decisions are temporary. Accept that mistakes will happen and realise it is no big deal as long as you can correct them quickly. Execute, build momentum, and move on.</p>
<h2 id="test-in-the-wild">Test in the wild</h2>
<p>Test your app via real world usage</p>
<p>Release beta features to a select few inside the real application itself. Have them use the beta features alongside the released features. This will expose these features to people’s real data and real workflow. And that’s where you’ll get real results.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide if it’s worth doing, and if so:</li>
<li>Do it quick – not perfect. just do it.</li>
<li>Save it. upload it. publish it</li>
<li>See what people think</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shrink-your-time">Shrink Your Time</h2>
<p>Estimates that stretch into weeks or months are fantasies. The truth is you just don’t know what’s going to happen that far in advance.</p>
<p>So shrink your time. Keep breaking down timeframes into smaller chunks. Instead of a 12 week project, think of it as 12 weeklong projects. Instead of guesstimating at tasks that take</p>
<p>30+ hours, break them down into more realistic 6-10 hour chunks. Then proceed one step at a time.</p>
<p>Give a programmer an afternoon to code a small, specific module and she’ll crank it out, ready to move onto the next one.</p>
<h2 id="unity">Unity</h2>
<p>Too many companies separate design, development, copywriting, support, and marketing into different silos.</p>
<p>It also creates a situation where staffers see just their own little world instead of the entire context of the web app.</p>
<p>Hire people with multiple talents who can wear different hats during development. The end result will be a more harmonious product.</p>
<h2 id="alone-time">Alone Time</h2>
<p>People need uninterrupted time to get things done</p>
<p>Set up a rule at work: Make half the day alone time. From 10am-2pm, no one can talk to one another (except during lunch). Or make the first or the last half of the day the alone time period. Just make sure this period is contiguous in order to avoid productivity-killing interruptions.</p>
<p>A successful alone time period means letting go of communication addiction. During alone time, give up instant messaging, phone calls, and meetings. Avoid any email thread that’s going to require an immediate response. Just shut up and get to work.</p>
<h2 id="meetings-are-toxic">Meetings Are Toxic</h2>
<p>Don’t have meetings</p>
<p>Meetings usually arise when a concept isn’t clear enough.
Simplify the concept so you can discuss it quickly via email or IM or Campfire.</p>
<p>There’s nothing more toxic to productivity than a meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>They break your work day into small, incoherent pieces that disrupt your natural workflow</li>
<li>They’re usually about words and abstract concepts, not real things (like a piece of code or some interface design)</li>
<li>They usually convey an abysmally small amount of information per minute</li>
<li>They often contain at least one moron that inevitably gets his turn to waste everyone’s time with nonsense</li>
<li>They drift off-subject easier than a Chicago cab in heavy snow</li>
<li>They frequently have agendas so vague nobody is really sure what they are about</li>
<li>They require thorough preparation that people rarely do anyway</li>
<li>For those times when you <em>absolutely must</em> have a meeting (this should be a rare event), stick to these simple rules:<ul>
<li>Set a 30 minute timer. When it rings, meeting’s over. Period.</li>
<li>Invite as few people as possible.</li>
<li>Never have a meeting without a clear agenda.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are too many meetings. Push back on meetings that do not make sense or are unproductive. Only book a meeting when you have an important business issue to discuss and you want or need input, approval, or agreement. Even then, resist the urge to invite everyone and their brother – don’t waste people’s time unnecessarily. *  Lisa Haneberg</em></p>
<h2 id="seek-and-celebrate-small-victories">Seek and Celebrate Small Victories</h2>
<p>Release something today</p>
<p>Motivation is local – if you aren’t motivated by what you are working on right now, then chances are it won’t be as good as it should be</p>
<p>Long, drawn out release cycles are motivation killers. They insert too much time between celebrations.</p>
<p>if you’re in the middle of a months-long release cycle, dedicate a day a week (or every two weeks) for some small victories.</p>
<ul>
<li>A new simple feature</li>
<li>A small enhancement to an existing feature</li>
<li>Rewriting some help text to reduce the support burden</li>
<li>Removing some form fields that you really don’t need</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="staffing">Staffing</h2>
<ul>
<li>There’s no need to get big early or later. Even if you have access to 100 of the very best people, it’s still a bad idea to try and hire them all at once.</li>
<li>So don’t hire. Really. Don’t hire people. Look for another way. Is the work that’s burdening you really necessary? What if you just don’t do it? Can you solve the problem with a slice of soft*  ware or a change of practice instead?</li>
<li>If there’s no other way, then consider a hire. But you should know exactly who to get, how to introduce them to the work, and the exact pain you expect them to relieve.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kick-the-tires">Kick the Tires</h2>
<p>Work with prospective employees on a test-basis first</p>
<p>Before hiring anyone give them a small project to chew on first. Then see how they handle the project, how they communicate, how they work, etc. Working with someone as they design or code a few screens will give you a ton of insight. You’ll learn pretty quickly whether or not the right vibe is there.</p>
<h2 id="actions-not-words">Actions, Not Words</h2>
<p>Judge a potential tech hire on an open source contribution or a side project</p>
<p>Judge based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quality of Work</p>
<ul>
<li>Many programmers can talk the talk but trip when it comes time to walk the walk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cultural perspective</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the specific decisions made by a candidate in coding, testing, and community arguments to see whether you’ve got a cultural match.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Level of passion</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of open source involvement often shows how much a candidate truly cares about programming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Completion percentage</p>
<ul>
<li>All the smarts, proper cultural leanings, and passion don’t amount to valuable software if a person can’t get stuff done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Social Match</p>
<ul>
<li>Working with someone over a long period of time, during both stress/relaxation and highs/lows, will show you their real personality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="get-well-rounded-individuals">Get Well Rounded Individuals</h2>
<p>Go for quick learning generalists over ingrained specialists</p>
<p>Small teams need people who can wear different hats.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need designers who can write.</li>
<li>You need programmers who understand design.</li>
<li>Everyone needs to have an organised mind.</li>
<li>Everyone needs to be able to communicate with customers.</li>
<li>And everyone needs to be willing and able to shift gears down the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>You want someone who can adjust and learn and flow as opposed to a stick-in-the-mud who can do only one thing.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-t-fake-enthusiasm">You can’t fake enthusiasm</h2>
<p>Go for happy and average over frustrated and great</p>
<p>Find someone who’s enthusiastic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone you can trust to get things done when left alone.</li>
<li>Someone who’s suffered at a bigger, slower company and longs for a new environment.</li>
<li>Someone who’s excited to build what you are building.</li>
<li>Someone who hates the same things you hate.</li>
<li>Someone who’s thrilled to climb aboard your train.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra points for asking questions</p>
<p>Observe whether a potential hire asks a lot of questions about your project.</p>
<p>Passionate programmers want to understand a problem as well as possible and will quickly propose potential solutions and improvements, which leads to a lot of questions.</p>
<h2 id="wordsmiths">Wordsmiths</h2>
<p>If you are trying to decide between a few people to fill a position, always hire the better writer.
Effective, concise writing and editing leads to effective, concise code, design, emails, instant messages, and more.
That’s because being a good writer is about more than words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good writers know how to communicate.</li>
<li>They make things easy to understand.</li>
<li>They can put themselves in someone else’s shoes.</li>
<li>They know what to omit.</li>
<li>They think clearly. And those are the qualities you need.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interface-design">Interface Design</h2>
<p>Design the interface before you start programming</p>
<p>Too many apps start with a program-first mentality.
Programming is the heaviest component of building an app</p>
<p>Design is relatively light.</p>
<p>A paper sketch is cheap and easy to change.
HTML designs are still relatively simple to modify or throw out.</p>
<p>The interface is your product</p>
<p>What people see is what you’re selling. If you leave it til the end to add an interface the gaps will show</p>
<p>Ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it make sense?</li>
<li>Is it easy to use?</li>
<li>Does it solve the problem at hand?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="epicentre-design">Epicentre Design</h2>
<p>Start from the core of the page and build outwards</p>
<p>Ignore the extremities: the navigation/tabs, footer, colours, sidebar, logo, etc. Instead, you start at the epicentre and design the most important piece of content first.</p>
<p>E.g: <em>if you are designing a page that displays a blog post, the blog post itself is the epicentre. Not the categories in the sidebar, not the header at the top, not the comment form at the bottom, but the actual blog post unit. Without the blog post unit, the page isn’t a blog post.</em></p>
<p>Epicentre design flips that process and allows you to focus on what really matters on day one.</p>
<p>The result is a more friendly, focused, usable screen for customers.</p>
<p>Three State Solution</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Design for regular, blank and error states</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regular - The screen people see when everything’s working fine and your app is flush with data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blank - The screen people see when using the app for the first time, before data is entered.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Error - The screen people see when something goes wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Blank State</p>
<ul>
<li>Set expectations with a thoughtful first-run experience</li>
<li>The blank state is your app’s first impression</li>
<li>The natural state of the app is one that’s devoid of data.</li>
<li>What should you include in a helpful blank slate?</li>
<li>Use it as an opportunity to insert quick tutorials and help blurbs.<ul>
<li>Give a sample screenshot of the page populated with data so people know what to expect<br> (and why they should stick around).</li>
<li>Explain how to get started, what the screen will eventually look like, etc.</li>
<li>Answer key questions that first-time viewers will ask:What is this page? What do I do now? How will this screen look once it’s full?</li>
<li>Set expectations and help reduce frustration, intimidation, and overall confusion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Get Defensive</p>
<ul>
<li>Design for when things go wrong</li>
<li>Your app may work great 90% of the time. But if you abandon customers in their time of need, they’re unlikely to forget it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="context-over-consistency">Context Over Consistency</h2>
<p>What makes sense here may not make sense there</p>
<p>It’s ok to be inconsistent if your design makes more sense that way. Give people just what matters.</p>
<p>Give them what they need when they need it and get rid of what they don’t. It’s better to be right than to be consistent.</p>
<h2 id="copywriting-is-interface-design">Copywriting is Interface Design</h2>
<p>You need to speak the same language as your audience too. Just because you’re writing a web app doesn’t mean you can get away with technical jargon.</p>
<p>Good writing is good design. It’s a rare exception where words don’t accompany design.</p>
<h2 id="one-interface">One Interface</h2>
<p>Incorporate admin features into the public interface</p>
<p>To avoid crappy-admin-screen syndrome, don’t build separate screens to deal with admin functions. Instead, build these functions (i.e. edit, add, delete) into the regular application interface.</p>
<p>The fewer screens you have to worry about, the better they’ll turn out.</p>
<h2 id="less-software">Less Software</h2>
<p>Keep your code as simple as possible</p>
<p>Each time you increase the amount of code, your software grows <em>exponentially</em> more complicated.
Solving 80% of the original problem for 20% of the effort is a major win.</p>
<p>The original problem is almost never so bad that it’s worth five times the effort to solve it.</p>
<p>Build products that do less:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less software is easier to manage.</li>
<li>Less software reduces your codebase and that means less maintenance busywork (and a happier staff).</li>
<li>Less software lowers your cost of change so you can adapt quickly.You can change your mind without having to change boatloads of code.</li>
<li>Less software results in fewer bugs. Less software means less support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Slow down too. Don’t take action on an idea for a week and see if it still seems like a great idea after the initial buzz wears off. The extra marinading time will often help your brain come up with an easier solution.</p>
<p>Encourage programmers to make counteroffers</p>
<p>“The way you suggested will take 12 hours. But there’s a way I can do it that will only take one hour. It won’t do x but it will do y.”</p>
<p>Also, search for detours around writing more software. Can you change the copy on the screen so that it suggests an alternate route to customers that doesn’t require a change in the software model?</p>
<h2 id="optimise-for-happiness">Optimise for Happiness</h2>
<p>Choose tools that keep your team excited and motivated</p>
<p>A happy programmer is a productive programmer. That’s why we optimise for happiness and you should too. Don’t just pick tools and practices based on industry standards or performance metrics.</p>
<p>They write simple, readable code. They take clean, expressive, readable, elegant approaches. They have fun.</p>
<h2 id="code-speaks">Code Speaks</h2>
<p>Listen to your code. It will offer suggestions. It will push back. It will tell you where the pitfalls reside. It will suggest new ways to do things. It will help you stick to a model of less software.</p>
<p>Your code can guide you to fixes that are cheap and light. Pay attention when an easy path emerges.</p>
<h2 id="manage-debt">Manage Debt</h2>
<p>You still need to recognise it as debt and pay it off at some point by cleaning up the hairy code or redesigning that so-so page.</p>
<p>If you don’t, you’ll just be paying interest (fixing hacks) instead of paying down the principal (and moving forward).</p>
<h2 id="open-doors">Open Doors</h2>
<p>Get data out in the world via RSS, APIs, etc</p>
<p>Don’t lock-in your customers. Let them get their information when they want it and how they want it.</p>
<p>To do that you’ve got to give up the idea of sealing in data. Instead, let it run wild.</p>
<h2 id="there-s-nothing-functional-about-a-functional-spec">There’s Nothing Functional about a Functional Spec</h2>
<p>These blueprint docs usually wind up having almost nothing to do with the finished product.</p>
<p>They don’t reflect reality. An app is not real until builders are building it, designers are designing it, and people are using it.</p>
<p>They’re about making everyone feel involved and happy which, while warm and fuzzy, isn’t all that helpful. They’re never about making tough choices and exposing costs, things that need to happen to build a great app.</p>
<p>A bunch of people agreeing on paragraphs of text isn’t a true agreement. Everyone may be reading the same thing but they’re thinking something different.</p>
<p>You know the least about something when you begin to build it. The more you build it, the more you use it, the more you know it.</p>
<p>There’s no pushback during spec phase. There’s no cost to writing something down and adding another bullet point. You can please someone who’s a pain by adding their pet feature.</p>
<p>A feature is signed off and agreed on. Even if you realise during development that it’s a bad idea, you’re stuck with it.</p>
<p>Write a one page story about what the app needs to do. Use plain language and make it quick. If it takes more than a page to explain it, then it’s too complex. This process shouldn’t take more than one day.</p>
<p>Then begin building the interface. This will be the alternative to the functional spec. Draw some quick and simple paper sketches. Then start coding it into html. Unlike para*  graphs of text that are open to alternate interpretations, interface designs are common ground that everyone can agree on.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-do-dead-documents">Don’t do Dead Documents</h2>
<p>Eliminate unnecessary paperwork</p>
<p>Unless a document is actually going to morph into something real, don’t produce it.</p>
<p>Documents that live separate to your product are worthless. They don’t get you anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="tell-me-a-story">Tell me a story</h2>
<p>If you find yourself requiring words to explain a new feature or concept, write a brief story about it. Don’t get technical, just tell a quick story, like you would in a normal conversation.</p>
<p>It’s not an essay. Just give the flow of what happens and if you can include the story with the screens you’re developing, all the better.</p>
<p>Stick to the experience instead of getting too hung up on details. Think strategy no tactics.</p>
<h2 id="use-real-words">Use Real Words</h2>
<p>Insert actual text instead of lorem ipsum.</p>
<p>Dummy text doesn’t not show you how long certain fields should be.</p>
<p>Dummy text doesn’t not show you how tables with expand or contract.</p>
<p>Dummy text doesn’t not show you what your app truly will look like.</p>
<p>When you just enter fake copy in rapid-fire fashion, you don’t know what it really feels like to fill out that form.</p>
<h2 id="personify-your-product">Personify Your Product</h2>
<p>Think of your product as a person. What type of person do you want it to be? Polite? Stern? Forgiving? Strict? Funny?</p>
<p>Once you decide, always keep those personality traits in mind as the product is built.</p>
<p>Use them to guide the copywriting, the interface, and the feature set.
Whenever you make a change, ask yourself if that change fits your app’s personality.</p>
<p>Your product has a voice – and it’s talking to your customers 24 hours a day.</p>
<h2 id="free-samples">Free Samples</h2>
<p>Give something away for free.</p>
<p>It’s a noisy world out there. In order to get people to notice you, give something away for free.</p>
<p>Examples include</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple. They offer iTunes software for free in order to build demand for the iPod and the iTunes music store.</li>
<li>Starbucks says a new purchase is stimulated for every five beverage samples they give away to customers</li>
</ul>
<p>We want people to experience the product, the interface, the usefulness of what we’ve built.  Once they’re hooked, they’re much more likely to upgrade to one of the paying plans</p>
<h2 id="easy-on-easy-off">Easy on, Easy off</h2>
<p>Make signup and cancellation a painless process</p>
<p>Provide a big, clear, signup button that pops and put it on each page of your marketing site. Tell folks how easy it is: “From sign-up to login in just 1 minute!”</p>
<p>There should always be a free option so customers can demo the app without entering credit card information.</p>
<p>“Cancel my account” is a link that’s clear as day on a person’s account page.</p>
<p>Also, make sure people can get their data out if they decide to leave.  This is crucial because giving people control over their information builds trust.</p>
<h2 id="silly-rabbit-tricks-are-for-kids">Silly Rabbit, Tricks are for Kids</h2>
<p>Avoid long-term contracts, sign-up fees, etc.</p>
<p>Products bill on a month to month basis.</p>
<p>Don’t try to find “tricky” ways to get more cash. Earn it.</p>
<h2 id="a-softer-bullet">A Softer Bullet</h2>
<p>Soften the blow of bad news with advance notice and grandfather clauses.</p>
<p>Also, consider a grandfather period that exempts existing customers for a certain period of time. These folks are your bread and butter and you want to make them feel valued, not gouged.</p>
<h2 id="promotion">Promotion</h2>
<p>Go from teaser to preview to launch</p>
<p>Teaser</p>
<ul>
<li>A few months ahead of time, start dropping hints. Let people know what you’re working on. Post a logo, post to your blog about the development. Stay vague but plant the seed. Also get a site running where you can collect emails from folks who are interested.</li>
<li>Reach out to industry insiders and tell them they will get an exclusive sneak preview of your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preview</p>
<ul>
<li>Few weeks ahead of launch, start previewing features. Give people behind the scenes access. Describe the theme of the product. At basecamp, they post screenshots and highlighted reminders, milestones and other features.</li>
<li>For Backpack, we posted our manifesto before launch. This got people thinking and talking about the app.</li>
<li>Offer special golden tickets to a few people so they can use the app early. You’ll get the benefit of having some beta testers while they’ll feel that special glow that people get from being early adopters.</li>
<li>Encourage people to sign up so you’ve got a foundation of emails to blitz once you launch. By the time we launch our apps, we have thousands of emails to ping which is a big help in gaining traction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Launch</p>
<ul>
<li>Get emails out to those who signed up.</li>
<li>Launch your full marketing site.</li>
<li>Spread the gospel as much as possible.</li>
<li>Get blogs to link to you.</li>
<li>Post about your progress:<ul>
<li>How many people have signed up?</li>
<li>What updates/tweaks have you made?</li>
<li>Show momentum and keep at it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-powerful-promo-site">A powerful promo site</h2>
<p>Build an ace promotional site that introduces people to your product
Include in the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview: Explain your app and its benefits.</li>
<li>Tour: Guide people through various features.</li>
<li>Screen captures and videos: Show people what the app actually looks like and how to use it.</li>
<li>Manifesto: Explain the philosophy and ideas behind it.</li>
<li>Case Studies: Provide real life examples that show what’s possible.  </li>
<li>Buzz: Testimonial quotes from customers, reviews, press, etc.</li>
<li>Forum: Offer a place for members of the community to help one another.</li>
<li>Pricing &amp; Sign-up: Get people into your app as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Weblog: Blogs keep your site fresh with news, tips, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ride-the-blog-wave">Ride the blog wave</h2>
<p>Blogging can be more effective than advertising (and it’s a hell of a lot cheaper)</p>
<p>Start off by creating a blog that not only touts your product but offers helpful advice, tips, tricks, links, etc.</p>
<p>The Signal vs. Noise blog gets thousands of unique readers a week thanks to the helpful, informative, and interesting bits and anecdotes they post on a daily basis.</p>
<h2 id="promote-through-education">Promote through education</h2>
<p>Share your knowledge with the world</p>
<p>You can give something back to the community that supports you and score some nice promotional exposure at the same time.</p>
<p>Education can come in many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips and tricks at your site that people will want to share with others</li>
<li>Speak at conferences and stay afterwards to meet and greet with attendees</li>
<li>Conduct workshops so curious fans can learn more and talk to you in the flesh</li>
<li>Give interviews to publications.</li>
<li>Write articles that share helpful information. And write books :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of the Yellow Fade Technique</p>
<ul>
<li>A method invented to subtly spotlight a recently changed area on a page.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feature-food">Feature Food</h2>
<p>New or interesting features are a great way to generate buzz for your application. Special interest groups love to chew up “feature food” and spit it back out to the community.</p>
<p>If you are using something new or noteworthy, go ahead and spotlight it for special interest groups.</p>
<h2 id="track-your-logs">Track your Logs</h2>
<p>Who’s linking to you? Who’s bitching about you? Which blogs listed at Technorati, Blogdex, Feedster, Del.icio.us, and Daypop are hot on your trail?</p>
<p>Find out and then make your presence felt. Leave comments at those blogs. Thank people for posting links.</p>
<p>Ask them if they want to be included on your special advance list</p>
<p>Respond to critiques thoughtfully. Something like: “We appreciate the feedback but we did it this way because...” Or “You raise a good point and we’re working on it.”</p>
<h2 id="inline-upsell">Inline Upsell</h2>
<p>Promote upgrade opportunities inside the app</p>
<p><em>“Tell folks that you’ll remove barriers if they upgrade. For example, in Basecamp you can’t upload files if you have a free account. When someone tries to upload a file, we don’t just turn them away. We explain why file uploading isn’t available and encourage them to upgrade to the paid version and explain why that’s a good idea.”</em></p>
<p>Existing customers are your best bet for sales</p>
<h2 id="name-hook">Name Hook</h2>
<p>Give your app a name that’s easy to remember</p>
<p>A big mistake a lot of people make is thinking their app’s name needs to be ultra descriptive.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about picking a name that vividly describes your tool’s purpose; That usually just leads to a generic, forgettable name.</p>
<p>Pick a name that’s short, catchy, and memorable and then run with it.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>Tear down the walls between support and development</p>
<p>Avoid building walls between your customers and the development/design team. Don’t outsource customer support to a call centre or third party.  Do it yourself. You, and your whole team, should know what your customers are saying.</p>
<p>When your customers are annoyed, you need to know about it. You need to hear their complaints. You need to get annoyed too.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to rely on statistical analysis to reveal your trouble spots. But stats aren’t the same as voices. You need to eliminate as many buffers as possible between you and the real voices of your customers.</p>
<p><em>If you want your steak cooked just how you like it, would you rather talk to the bus boy or the chef that’s actually cooking it?  *  David Greiner, founder, Campaign Monitor</em></p>
<h2 id="zero-training">Zero Training</h2>
<p>Use inline help and FAQs so your product doesn’t require a manual or training</p>
<p>Strive to build a tool that requires zero training.  How do you do this?</p>
<p>Keep everything simple</p>
<p>Inline help text and FAQs at potential points of confusion</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>we offer preemptive support on the screen that allows people to upload their logo to Basecamp.</li>
<li>Some people experienced a problem where they would keep seeing an old logo due to a browser-caching issue.</li>
<li>we added a link to an FAQ that instructed customers to force-reload their browsers in order to see the new logo. Before we did this, we would get 5 emails a day about this problem. Now we get none.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="answer-quick">Answer Quick</h2>
<p>Quick turnaround time on support queries should be a top priority</p>
<p>Answer 90% of all email support requests within 90 minutes. People love it.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have a perfect answer, say something. You can buy goodwill with a response that is delivered quickly in an open, honest way.</p>
<p>If someone is complaining about an issue that can’t be fixed immediately, tell them something like, “We hear what you’re saying and we’ll be working on it in the future.” It’s a great way to diffuse a potentially negative situation.</p>
<h2 id="tough-love">Tough Love</h2>
<p>Be willing to say no to customers</p>
<p>If we added every single thing our customers requested, no one would want our products.</p>
<p>The number one request we get on customer surveys is to keep Basecamp simple.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite some complaints, we decided not to support ie5 with our products. We decided it was more important<br>  to worry about the other 93%.</li>
<li>It’s critical that you as a development company love your product. And you won’t love your product if it’s filled with a bunch of stuff you don’t agree with.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-fine-forum">In Fine Forum</h2>
<p>Use forums or chat to let customers help each other</p>
<p>At our product forums, customers post tips and tricks, feature requests, stories, and more. We pop in from time to time to offer some assistance but the forums are mainly a place for the community to help each other and share their experiences with the product.</p>
<h2 id="publicise-your-screwups">Publicise Your Screwups</h2>
<p>Get bad news out there and out of the way</p>
<p>For example, Basecamp was down once for a few hours in the middle of the night. 99% of our customers never knew, but we still posted an “unexpected downtime” notice to our Everything Basecamp blog. We thought our customers deserved to know.</p>
<h2 id="one-month-tuneup">One Month Tuneup</h2>
<p>Issue a major update 30 days after launch</p>
<p>A quick update shows momentum.</p>
<p>It gives you a second wave of buzz. It reaffirms initial good feelings.</p>
<p>lets you put the focus on the most crucial components before launch. Instead of trying to squeeze in a few more things, you can start by perfecting just the core feature set.</p>
<p>Once it’s out there you can start getting customer feedback and you’ll know which areas require attention next.</p>
<h2 id="keep-the-posts-coming">Keep the Posts Coming</h2>
<p>Show you product is alive by keeping an ongoing product development blog post-launch</p>
<p>Things to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faqs</li>
<li>How-tos</li>
<li>Tips &amp; tricks</li>
<li>New features, updates, &amp; fixes</li>
<li>Buzz/press</li>
</ul>
<p>A blog not only shows your app is alive, it makes your company seem more human</p>
<h2 id="better-not-beta">Better, Not Beta</h2>
<p>Don’t use “beta” as a scapegoat</p>
<p>Beta passes the buck to your customers. If you’re not confident enough about your release then how can you expect the public to be?</p>
<p>Put it out and call it a release. Otherwise, you’re just making excuses.</p>
<h2 id="all-bugs-are-not-created-equal">All Bugs are not created equal</h2>
<p>Prioritise your bugs (and even ignore some of them)</p>
<p>Just because you discover a bug in your product, doesn’t mean it’s time to panic. All software has bugs – it’s just a fact of life.</p>
<p>Prioritise your bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people are affected?</li>
<li>How bad is the problem?</li>
<li>Does this bug deserve immediate attention or can it wait?</li>
<li>What can you do right now that will have the greatest impact for the greatest number of people?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, don’t create a culture of fear surrounding bugs. Bugs happen.</p>
<p>Don’t constantly seek someone to blame.</p>
<p>If customers complain about a bug, be straight up with them. Tell them you’ve noted the issue and are dealing with it.</p>
<h2 id="ride-out-the-storm">Ride out the storm</h2>
<p>Wait until knee-jerk reactions to changes die down before taking action</p>
<p>When you rock the boat there will be waves. After you introduce a new feature, change a policy, or remove something, knee-jerk reactions, often negative, will pour in.</p>
<p>Ride out this initial 24-48 hour period, things will usually settle down. Most people respond before they’ve really dug in and used whatever you’ve added</p>
<h2 id="keep-up-with-the-joneses">Keep up with the Joneses</h2>
<p>Subscribe to news feeds about your product and your competitors</p>
<p>With rss, this constantly changing info will be delivered right to you so you’re always up to speed.</p>
<h2 id="beware-the-bloat-monster">Beware the Bloat Monster</h2>
<p>More mature doesn’t have to mean more complicated</p>
<p>Just because something gets older and more mature, doesn’t mean it needs to get more complicated.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be a Swiss army knife. You can just be a screwdriver.</p>
<p>Don’t inflate just for the sake of inflating. That’s how apps get bloated.</p>
<p>With web-based software based on the subscription model, people pay a monthly fee to use the service. You don’t need to keep up selling them by adding more and more and more, you just need to provide an ongoing valuable service.</p>
<h2 id="go-with-the-flow">Go with the Flow</h2>
<p>Be open to new paths and changes in direction</p>
<p>Be a surfer. Watch the ocean. Figure out where the big waves are breaking and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Flickr. It began as a multiplayer online game called The Game Neverending. Its creators soon realised the photo-sharing aspect of the game was a more plausible product than the game itself</li>
</ul>
