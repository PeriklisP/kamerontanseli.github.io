<p>Of all the things which wisdom has contrived which contribute to a blessed life, none is more important, more fruitful, than friendship — Cicero</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pleasure (ἡδονή) is the greatest good. The way to attain such pleasure is to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one&#39;s desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility.</p>
<p>Following from this, one should shun politics because it leads to frustrations and ambitions which can directly conflict with the pursuit for peace of mind and virtues.</p>
<p>Live in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of pleasure possible during one&#39;s lifetime, yet doing so moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in such pleasure.</p>
<p>Place priority on pleasures of the mind rather than on physical pleasures:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pleasures of the body</strong>: These pleasures involve sensations of the body, such as the act of eating delicious food or of being in a state of comfort free from pain, and exist only the present. One can only experience pleasures of the body in the moment, meaning they only exist as a person is experiencing them</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pleasures of the mind</strong>: These pleasures involve mental processes and states; feelings of joy, the lack of fear, and pleasant memories are all examples of pleasures of the mind. These pleasures of the mind do not only exist in the present, but also in the past and future, since memory of a past pleasant experience or the expectation of some potentially pleasing future can both be pleasurable experiences. Because of this, the pleasures of the mind are considered to be greater than those of the body.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Act unjustly even if the act was initially unnoticed because of possibly being caught and punished. Both punishment and fear of punishment would cause disturbance and prevent happiness.</p>
<p>Have great emphasis on developing friendships as this is the basis of a satisfying life.</p>
<p>Do not fear death for death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.</p>
<p>Live by the natural desires:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Natural and necessary</strong>: These desires are limited desires that are innately present in all humans; it is part of human nature to have them. They are necessary for one of three reasons: necessary for happiness, necessary for freedom from bodily discomfort, and necessary for life. Clothing would belong to the first two categories, while something like food would belong to the third.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Natural but not necessary</strong>: These desires are innate to humans, but they do not need to be fulfilled for their happiness or their survival. Wanting to eat delicious food when one is hungry is an example of a natural but not necessary desire. The main problem with these desires is that they fail to substantially increase a person&#39;s happiness, and at the same time require effort to obtain and are desired by people due to false beliefs that they are actually necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Not natural nor necessary</strong>: These desires are neither innate to humans nor required for happiness or health; indeed, they are also limitless and can never be fulfilled. Desires of wealth or fame would fall under this category, and such desires are to be avoided because they will ultimately only bring about discomfort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If one follows only natural and necessary desires, then, according to Epicurus, one would be able to reach aponia and ataraxia and thereby the highest form of happiness.</p>
<p>Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (telos), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. <strong>This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ataraxia (tranquility, freedom from fear) and aponia (absence of pain) as the height of happiness</strong>. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia.</p></main></body></html>
