      <h3 id="total-recall">Total Recall</h3>
<h4 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h4>
<p>Liberating the poor is a good way to stimulate the economy. Shops would allow poorer families to buy items and pay it off over several months.</p>
<p>Arnold&#39;s father&#39;s answer to life was discipline. He had a strict routine which would never change: he&#39;d get up at 6am, get milk from the farm next door and play sports for several hours. Exercises were added to chores, and he would have to earn his breakfast by doing situps.</p>
<p>In the afternoon he would finish his homework, chores and be made to play soccer no matter the weather.</p>
<p>In the evening he would have to reflect on his activities. Each report required ten pages at least which would then be marked for grammar and spelling. If a word was spelt wrong he would have to copy it fifty times over.</p>
<p>His father had no patience with our problems. If we wanted a bike, he&#39;d tell us to earn the money for it ourselves. </p>
<p>He never felt good enough, strong enough, smart enough. His father would let him know there was constantly room for improvement. A lot sons would have been crippled by his father&#39;s demands, but instead the discipline rubbed off on him. He turned it into drive.</p>
<h4 id="building-the-body">Building the body</h4>
<p>The biggest obstacle to successful training is that the body adjusts to quickly. Do the same sequence of lifts every day, and even if you keep adding weight, you&#39;ll see your muscle growth slow and then stop; the muscles become very efficient at performing the sequence they expect.</p>
<p>The goal was not to have fun but to become the world champion in bodybuilding. If I was going to get my seven hours of sleep, I had to be in bed by eleven. There was always time for fun, and we always had fun anyway.</p>
<p>I never went to a competition to compete, I went to win. Even though I didn&#39;t win everytime, that was my mindset. I became a total animal. If you tuned into my thoughts before a competition, you would hear something like: <em>&quot;I deserve that pedestal, I own it, and the sea ought to part for me. Just get out the fucking way, I&#39;m on a mission. So just step aside and gimme the trophy.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The limit is in your mind&quot;</em> he said. <em>&quot;Think about it: three hundred pounds is less than walking. You weight two hundred fifty, so you are lifting two hundred fifty pounds with each calf every time you take a step. To really train, you have to go beyond that.&quot;</em> And he was right. The limit I thought existed was purely psychological. Now that I&#39;d seen someone do a thousand pounds, I started making leaps in my training.</p>
<p>So I stuck with my original vision: a letter or a telegram would come, calling me to America. It was up to me to perform well and do something extraordinary, because if Reg Park had gotten to go there by doing something extraordinary, then I also would get to go by doing something extraordinary. In judging my progress, I used him and Steve Reeves as my benchmarks.</p>
<p>I made sure nothing else interfered. Not recreation, not my job, not travel, not girls, not organising the Mr. Europe contest. I took time for all those things, of course, but my first priority remained working out hard four or five hours per day, six days per week.</p>
<p>I felt the judging had been unfair, but I discovered that this wasn&#39;t the real cause of my pain. It was the fact that I had failed - not my body, but my vision and my drive. I could of found a way to train more even without access to a gym, I could of focused on my posing - nothing had stopped me from doing that. I hadn&#39;t done everything in my power to prepare.</p>
<p>He did his bench press at half reps without ever locking his elbows, that kept full tension all the time on the pectoral muscle, and he had beautiful full pecs.</p>
<h4 id="playing-with-property">Playing with Property</h4>
<p>Over the next 2 or 3 years, I did research. Every day I would look at the real estate section in the newspaper, studying the prices and reading the stories and ads. I got to where I knew every square block of Santa Monica. I knew how much the property values increased north of Olympic Boulevard versus north of Wilshire versus north of Sunset. I understood about schools and restaurants and proximity to the beach.</p>
<p>Actors I met in the gym were always looking for places to stay, so eventually there were four actors living there. It was a way to build connections in the business I wanted to get into. Best of all, I&#39;d moved out of an apartment where I had to pay $1,300 a month in rent and into a property that paid for itself from Day One, just as I planned.</p>
<p>Seeing me pull off a $215k deal left my old friend Artie Zeller in shock. For days afterward, he kept asking how I had the balls to do it. He could not understand because he never wanted any risk in his life.</p>
<h4 id="training-the-mind">Training the Mind</h4>
<p>You need to be your own trainer. When you do dumbbell curls, for example, you need to see if one arm trails the other.</p>
<p>Hearing them talk about the need to disconnect and refresh the mind was like a revelation. <em>&quot;Arnold, you&#39;re an idiot&quot;</em> I told myself. <em>&quot;You spend all this time on you rbody, but you never think about your mind, how to make it sharper and relieve the stress. When you have muscle cramps, you have to do more stretching, take a Jacuzzi, put on ice packs, take more minerals. So why aren&#39;t you thinking that the mind also can have a problem? It&#39;s overstressed, or it&#39;s tired, it&#39;s bored, it&#39;s fatigued, it&#39;s about to blow up - let&#39;s learn tools for that&quot;</em>. </p>
<p>One observation that emerged was that weight training was a better confidence builder than, say, soccer. In soccer, sometimes you make a good kick and sometimes not, but in weight training, you know when you lift four plates that the next time you will able to lift four plates. This predictability helped the kids gain confidence quickly.</p>
<h4 id="being-the-boss">Being the Boss</h4>
<p>I paid them fairly and drew on my Austrian upbringing to make myself a good employer. A pension plan and great medical insurance were automatic - nobody has to ask for that. And I paid 14 months of salary per year rather then twelve - the 13th month was your summer vacation pay, and the 14th month was your holiday bonus so that you could take care of your family at Christmas.</p>
<p>My other technique was to make them feel included. They were learning on the job just like I was. When I was in the office, we would analyze all the stuff that was happening to me. The women would sit around and each would give her point of view. Even if I didn&#39;t agree, I&#39;d take it in.</p>
<p>Everything I did could have been my hobby. It was my hobby, in a way. I was passionate about all of it. My definition of living is to have excitement always; that&#39;s the difference between living and existing.</p>
<p>When I wanted to know more about business and politics, I used the same approach I did when I wanted to learn about acting: I got to know as many people as I could who were really good at it.</p>
<p>People were always talkinbg about how few performers there are at the top of the ladder, but I was always convinced there was room for one more. I felt that, because there was so little room, people got intimidated and felt more comfortable staying on the bottom of the ladder. But, in fact, the more people that think that, the more crowded the bottom of the ladder becomes! Don&#39;t go where it&#39;s crowded. Go where it&#39;s empty. Even though it&#39;s harder to get there, that&#39;s where you belong and where there&#39;s less competition.</p>
