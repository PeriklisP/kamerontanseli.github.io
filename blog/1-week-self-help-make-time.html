What tactics do you want to try tomorrow?\n\nAs per my previous statement. I don't think the Highlight is very important here. Not only that but the tactics questions just aren't all that useful either. If I'm distracted by my phone I'm not going to try a different tactic tomorrow. I'm going to need to stop using my phone.\n\nI feel like I'm nitpicking but this part of the book should be about where you spend your time rather than how you feel.\n\n#### Common Sense\n\nA lot of the book felt like common sense. For example:\n\n*   Increase your energy by exercising\n*   Eating healthy\n*   Answer emails in one go\n*   Plan out your day\n*   Delete social media apps\n\n## So what's the rating?\n\n##### 4/10\n\n**Pros:**\n\n*   Useful for people who haven't read productivity books before\n*   Cute and simple illustrations.\n*   Easy to implement tactics.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n*   A lot of the book is just common sense\n*   Few tactics have that much of a dramatic impact.\n*   Highlight and Reflect exercises are too tied to the book and or aren't used throughout the day.","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2020-05-21T11:24:23.000Z","hero_image":"../static/posts/81-11NToHvL.jpg","title":"I spent 7 days following the Make Time book and here's what I learned."},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""}},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"1-week-self-help-make-time"},"buildId":"sKigvmBxHeR5ojdFW8lLh","dynamicBuildId":false,"nextExport":true}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/blog/[slug]" src="/_next/static/sKigvmBxHeR5ojdFW8lLh/pages/blog/[slug].js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/_next/static/sKigvmBxHeR5ojdFW8lLh/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-e1f7b6ddb3fae2db1f5d.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.0647a33e7070b3b816f2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-f116230a2e83c52060c3.js" async=""></script></body></html>
