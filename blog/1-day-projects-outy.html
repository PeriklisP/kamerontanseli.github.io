In the time I've felt my dependence on social apps like Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit has increased, slowly draining my energy and attention away from important projects of mine.\n\nAfter a week or two of feeling lethargic I fired up my old Kindle and stumbled upon Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. It was a book I purchased and read a while ago but never really took much notice of.\n\nIn a nutshell while Jake and John were at Google they both felt like they were wasting time being distracted every day. So they developed a highlight, laser, energise and reflect system to improve their productivity.\n\n## So what worked?\n\nAfter 3 days of trying to find exactly how to implement the Make Time system I finally cracked it (well my interpretation of it). Here are the tactics that worked for me.\n\n### No Caffeine after 4 pm\n\nAs a Developer, coffee is very much ingrained into our lifestyles from early on in our careers. I even have a Nespresso machine next to my bed! But I never really read up on coffee and it's side effects, I kinda just assumed energy for 1 hour and then have a crash sort of deal.\n\nBut that's not the case. Caffeine stays present within the body for up to 6 hours. This means any caffeine consumed after 4 pm will still be in the system while you're trying to get to sleep at 10 pm (not so good).\n\n![](../static/posts/image-1.png)\n\n[https://www.sketchplanations.com/post/153511487793/the-half-life-of-caffeine-is-about-4-hours-the](https://www.sketchplanations.com/post/153511487793/the-half-life-of-caffeine-is-about-4-hours-the)\n\n**So what were the benefits of this?**\n\n*   I felt tired and fell asleep much earlier than I used to do. Around 10 pm rather than midnight.\n\n### Thirty Minute Calendar\n\nEvery morning I'll wake up and plan out my day. I'll schedule every task I need to do from 8 am till 8 pm. This includes but not limited to Showers, Breakfast, Reading, Work, and Meetings. I aim for 30-minute events as they're the most realistic in terms of time spent.\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-05-21-at-11.27.05.png)\n\nMy typical day on the Make Time schedule\n\nIf you're on a Mac I highly recommend importing both your work and personal calendars together. The default Mac calendar app makes it super easy to move around and adjust events as you move throughout your day.\n\n**So what were the benefits of this?**\n\n*   It completely removed the thought of \"What's next?\"\n*   Increased my reading time from 1 hour to 3+ hours a day\n*   I've made significant progress on an app idea of mine\n*   My mornings feel more structured.\n*   You can also look back on your day and see exactly where you spent your time.\n\n### The Distraction Free Phone\n\nHaving just bought myself a new Pixel I was loving all the new features and ease of use of the operating system. One thing that caught my eye and changed everything for me this week was the \"Focus Mode\" feature (Downtime on IOS devices).\n\n![](../static/posts/Focus-Mode-1-Phone-Square.gif)\n\n[https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-focus-mode/](https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-focus-mode/)\n\nHaving the ability to choose which apps to allow notifications and access to for a while is game-changing. No more Twitter, Instagram, or FreeTrade notifications. If I want to take a break I can disable it for 5-10 minutes and it even comes with a timer that auto enables it after a short break.\n\n**So what were the benefits of this?**\n\n*   Screen time went from around 7hrs to 5hrs (I sometimes use Kindle on my phone which takes up an hour a day)\n*   I was less distracted when in my \"flow\" which resulted in 3-4 hour development and reading sessions.\n*   My workouts were finished within 40 minutes instead of 1.2 hours. I check my phone during the rest time.\n\n## So what didn't work?\n\nAs with anything in life, nothing is guaranteed to work 100% of the time. I felt a lot of the tactics in the book were common sense or just a utopian style sort of thinking. Here are a few notable things that didn't work for me:\n\n### Highlights\n\nThe Highlight method in Make Time is a way of choosing what your focus will be for that day. For example: \"Talk a walk\" or \"Write 10 pages for my new book\".\n\nInstead of stressing over whats the most important highlight for your day. I recommend just setting aside time in your calendar to focus on personal projects instead of individual tasks (reminds me of Paul Graham's \"[Maker's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)\" article).\n\nThis will give you the time to decompress and work on whatever pops into your head as you go about your day.\n\n### Reflections\n\nI love to reflect on my performance. I generally like to use the 80/20 Pareto/Tim Ferriss reflection methods at the end of every month as a sort of general overview of my time.\n\nMake Time's reflection exercises revolves around the book:\n\n1.  Note down your Highlight\n2.  Rate out of ten how focused you were that day\n3.  Rate out of ten how energised you were that day\n4.  What tactics worked for you?\n5.  What tactics do you want to try tomorrow?\n\nAs per my previous statement. I don't think the Highlight is very important here. Not only that but the tactics questions just aren't all that useful either. If I'm distracted by my phone I'm not going to try a different tactic tomorrow. I'm going to need to stop using my phone.\n\nI feel like I'm nitpicking but this part of the book should be about where you spend your time rather than how you feel.\n\n### Common Sense\n\nA lot of the book felt like common sense. For example:\n\n*   Increase your energy by exercising\n*   Eating healthy\n*   Answer emails in one go\n*   Plan out your day\n*   Delete social media apps\n\n## So what's the rating?\n\n### 4/10\n\n**Pros:**\n\n*   Useful for people who haven't read productivity books before\n*   Cute and simple illustrations.\n*   Easy to implement tactics.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n*   A lot of the book is just common sense\n*   Few tactics have that much of a dramatic impact.\n*   Highlight and Reflect exercises are too tied to the book and or aren't used throughout the day.","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2020-05-21T11:24:23.000Z","hero_image":"../static/posts/81-11NToHvL.jpg","title":"I spent 7 days following the Make Time book"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"1-week-self-help-make-time"},{"document":{"content":"\nSince my last article I've been getting a lot of questions on Twitter on how to find business ideas. I'm no guru myself but I do end up with a lot of SaaS ideas (almost daily at this point).\n\n\u003e [@KameronTanseli](https://twitter.com/KameronTanseli?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Hi, please suggest some idea that a single developer can make, that make $100 per month.\n\u003e \n\u003e — Mustafa Hanif (@MustafaHanif8) [May 12, 2020](https://twitter.com/MustafaHanif8/status/1260121626856865794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nTo name a few ideas I've had recently...\n\n*   A discovery site for accessing paid, membership-only Slack groups\n*   Slack command to buy a slack space owner a Coffee\n*   Founder Chats, weekly recorded zoom calls with my founder friends where we review a maker's new product.\n*   Printable Meal Plans from a Google Sheet (PTs love using Google Sheets for everything)\n*   [Buy \u0026 Sell Zapier Workflows](http://copythatworkflow.com/) on an Online Marketplace\n*   [A journal based on Fear Setting](http://thefearsettingjournal.com/) by Tim Ferriss\n\nOkay, the last two I'm acting on but you're free to take the rest :)\n\n## Generating your own Ideas\n\nIn the past [I have talked about how to come up with better niche ideas](/if-you-want-to-have-great-startup-ideas-then-be-a-weirdo/). Since then I've read up on a lot of new tactics just solely based on analysis. So here's what I found:\n\n*   Unbundle existing platforms ([Zapier](/first-it-was-craiglist-next-its-zapier/), [Craigslist](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus), [AWS](https://www.tclauson.com/2019/09/11/Unbundling-AWS.html) etc)\n*   [Unique and interesting domain names](https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/)\n*   [Analysing market numbers with GTrends and FB Ads](https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/)\n*   Turn popular book methods into apps (e.g: [5 Minute Journal](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/five-minute-journal/id1062945251))\n*   Create directories for niche groups (e.g: [Glide Apps](https://community.glideapps.com/c/app-showcase), [Sheet2Site Showcase](https://www.sheet2site.com/showcase/))\n*   [Analysing Google Keywords Searches](https://startupbook.net/)\n\nIf the above doesn't generate anything exciting for you. Try just calling up your friends and asking them about their day at work and what challenges they're having etc. People love to talk about their problems.","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2020-05-13T09:33:54.000Z","hero_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1532619675605-1ede6c2ed2b0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1\u0026q=80\u0026fm=jpg\u0026crop=entropy\u0026cs=tinysrgb\u0026w=2000\u0026fit=max\u0026ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","title":"Finding Good Ideas"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"finding-good-ideas"},{"document":{"content":"\nAs I delve deeper into the no-code space I see a lot of Zapier, Integromat and [Tray.io](https://tray.io) workflows. Some of these are actually quite complex and require some programming knowledge to understand them (which kind of defeats the point of no-code).  \n  \nAs I was looking at some of these workflows, I couldn't help but think how there will be this eventual shift like with Craiglist where companies will spring up that just focus on certain more complex popular workflows.\n\nTake for example a project of mine, [gsheet2mail.com](https://gsheet2mail.com), you could make it in Zapier like so:\n\n1.  Create a Zap\n2.  Query for your spreadsheet\n3.  Parse the fields of your spreadsheet into something usable\n4.  Connect the result of #3 and pipe it into a RSS feed connector\n5.  Copy the webhook URL and paste it into Mailchimp\n6.  Realise that Mailchimp queries your RSS feed a lot\n7.  Run out of Zaps\n8.  Pay $29 per month\n\nCompare that to the custom app I built:\n\n1.  Sign in with google\n2.  Copy the example spreadsheet\n3.  Paste in your new spreadsheet URL\n4.  Connect to Mailchimp\n5.  Done\n\nEven if the customer needed to go premium the cost would be significantly lower (around $6 a month) because I don't need to support massive infrastructure or bother about investor pressure.\n\nSo my advice if you're looking for your next indie software idea. Just observe what these no-coders are automating on Zapier and build a nice UI around it.\n\n\u003e “Complexity can be tamed, but it requires considerable effort to do it well. Decreasing the number of buttons and displays is not the solution. The solution is to understand the total system, to design it in a way that allows all the pieces fit nicely together, so that initial learning as well as usage are both optimal. Years ago, Larry Tesler, then a vice president of Apple, argued that the total complexity of a system is a constant: as you make the person's interaction simpler, the hidden complexity behind the scenes increases. Make one part of the system simpler, said Tesler, and the rest of the system gets more complex. This principle is known today as \"Tesler's law of the conservation of complexity.\" Tesler described it as a tradeoff: making things easier for the user means making it more difficult for the designer or engineer.”  \n\u003e ― **Donald A.

For those not aware of Marco Pierre White. You might know his apprentice. Gordon Ramsey.\n\nI'm just in awe with the way Marco, at every level, strives for perfection. For example, Marco would go and inspect the fish and meat at his local fisheries and butchers to ensure quality.\n\n**His real secret is only doing simple dishes, 7 ingredients or less, and having a falcon-like focus on each part** of the meal to create something extraordinary.\n\nDeep down I also strive for that level of perfection in what I do.

Most likely your go to analytics tool is Google Analytics.\n\n## Focus on one metric\n\n*   Page views are meaningless unless extracted into a conversion rate.\n*   Sessions are meaningless unless extracted into a conversion rate.\n*   Daily active user charts are just plain confusing and best avoided.\n\nWhat I'm trying to hint at is that Google Analytics is full of really pretty charts that you'll waste your time worrying about. Unless you're a Google Analytics wizard you don't know how to setup goals and trigger events and in my opinion don't bother.\n\nThere are plenty of tools out there like [Full Story](https://fullstory.com) or [Hot Jar](https://www.hotjar.com/) that offer conversion targets based on user events out of the box as a main feature.

I'm pretty sure you can put your own unique flair or solution to whatever problem your trying to address.\n\nIf we just stopped after one person made a CRM.

I'm not going to build a SPA if its just me working on it. I need quick turn arounds and a low amount of JS errors so I can get a good night's rest.\n\nI chose Express as its the most mature out of the other alternatives. I know if I encounter a problem that someone has solved it with Express.\n\nNotable packages to use with Express include:\n\n*   [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org) for Authentication\n*   [Flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-flash) for Notifications\n\n## Handlebars\n\nI chose Handlebars because its easy to learn and simple to use.

But at Tray.io our website has over 500 hundred thousand pages. We've definitely stress tested Gatsby.\n\nSo here's a few tips that I learn't along the way...\n\n## Keep your queries in your component\n\nOne issue that did arise when building out 500 hundred thousand generated pages was that we had unknowingly created 70 thousand [page queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/querying-data/#querying-data-with-a-page-query) instead of 1 static query.\n\nThe reason this happened was that we had moved the graphql query outside of the component:\n\n    const query = graphql`\n     query {\n       allBlogPosts {\n         title\n       }\n     }\n    `\n    \n    const SampleComponent = () =\u003e (\n      \u003cStaticQuery \n       query={query}\n       render={data =\u003e {...}}\n      /\u003e\n    )\n    \n\nThe reason why this happened was due to two things:\n\n1.  We named our query `query` which is a [special name in Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/querying-data/#directions) when they compile the page files (Note: changing the name still had the same effect).\n2.  The code which decompiles StaticQuery struggles with outside placed queries ( we're still unsure on this)\n\nWe saw an decrease in query times by switching to the hook version of `StaticQuery` :\n\n    const { site } = useStaticQuery(\n        graphql`\n          query {\n            site {\n              siteMetadata {\n                title\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        `\n      )\n    \n\nI think this worked because the [check for whether a hook is used is a lot simpler](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/dd344ac4ea292f8b29aa4c55cc08ebc0f19cd761/packages/gatsby/src/query/file-parser.js#L45) compared to the complexity of checking the StaticQuery AST. Less complexity less bugs I guess.\n\n## Stop using all in your queries\n\nIf you're querying for a single blog post then instead of doing an `all` with a filter, you can filter on the singular object. No more checks for whether `edges` has results:\n\n    // before\n    query Test($slug: String) {\n      post: allBlogPosts(limit: 1, filter: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            title\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \n    // after\n    query Test($slug: String) {\n      post: blogPost(slug: { eq: $slug }) {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n## Limit the amount of data passed to createPage\n\nYou might be tempted like we were to pass down a huge query result to a `pageContext` during build time. But you'd be mistaken...\n\nThe `pageContext` is type checked during the build process as it's passed to a page query ([You can turn this off](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/scaling-issues/#switch-off-type-inference-for-sitepagecontext) but I don't recommend it).\n\nInstead pass down the slug of the page and use a `StaticQuery` to fetch a one time huge query result.","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2020-05-01T09:21:18.000Z","hero_image":"../static/posts/34442516-fb1a1a3c-ecc2-11e7-8fe8-530435f22336.jpg","title":"Optimizing Gatsby"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"optimizing-gatsby"},{"document":{"content":"\nPrerequisites\n\n*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Installed\n*   [A code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIn order to scrape a website in 2020 we need to make sure we're using something that can click, tap and scroll as websites have become a lot more dynamic since 1999.\n\nLuckily [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) is a Node API that allows us to control a [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) using simple code commands.\n\nTo get started we need to install Puppeteer:\n\n    npm i puppeteer --save\n    \n\nThen create a JS file called `index.js` and import Puppeteer like so:\n\n    const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n    \n\n## Basic Example\n\nBefore we do any Puppeteering we need to create an [Async IIFE](https://anthonychu.ca/post/async-await-typescript-nodejs/):\n\n    ;(async () =\u003e {\n     // code goes here\n    })();\n    \n\nThis will allow us to write `await` calls which are needed as the puppeteer API is asynchronous. Now let's open and close a browser instance:\n\n    ;(async () =\u003e {\n      // Opens the browser\n      const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n      // Opens a new tab\n      const page = await browser.newPage();\n        \n      // closes the entire browser\n      await browser.close();\n    })();\n    \n\nThen after we've got our browser setup let's navigate the tab we opened to go to [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/):\n\n    (async () =\u003e {\n      const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n      const page = await browser.newPage();\n      // navigates the tab to load HN\n      await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com/');\n      await browser.close();\n    })();\n    \n\nGreat now that we have a program that can open HackerNews. Let's grab the top 10 headlines:\n\n    (async () =\u003e {\n      const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n      const page = await browser.newPage();\n      await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com/');\n      // queries the page and returns an Array of Elements\n      const headlines = await page.$$eval(\n       '.storylink', \n       // grab the top 10 and get the titles\n       stories =\u003e stories.slice(0, 10).map(s =\u003e s.innerText)\n      );\n      // log to the console\n      console.log(headlines.join('\\n'))\n      await browser.close();\n    })();\n    \n\nOur console should now output a result like this:\n\n    Using Reinforcement Learning in the Algorithmic Trading Problem\n    Show HN: Insomnia Designer – Open-source collaborative editor for API design\n    What other coronaviruses tell us about SARS-CoV-2\n    Hacking Together an E-ink Dashboard\n    Lyft lays off 17% of workforce, furloughs hundreds more\n    Recovered virus patients retest positive due to 'dead' virus fragments: experts\n    Why Segment Went Back to a Monolith\n    Iron Ox is looking for a DevOps engineer to help scale automated indoor farming\n    Good writing is a business advantage\n    Building a WireGuard jail with FreeBSD's standard tools\n    \n\n## Clicking Elements\n\nA more advanced example is clicking an element on the page. Luckily with Puppeteer its quite straight forward. Here's an example of clicking the upvote button on the front page of HN:\n\n    (async () =\u003e {\n      const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n      const page = await browser.newPage();\n      // navigates to HN\n      await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com/');\n      // clicks the first vote arrow on the page\n      await page.click('.votearrow')\n      await browser.close();\n    })();","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2020-04-29T20:07:20.000Z","hero_image":"../static/posts/5b2d227f688967b0997ea7d0a0a4080f.png","title":"Getting Started with Puppeteer"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"how-to-use-puppeteer-to-scrape-sites"},{"document":{"content":"\nIf you've been following my activity on Twitter you would have seen my latest project, [One Page a Day](https://onepageday.co.uk/), an email service that sends you one page from a new book every morning at 7am.\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-17.16.25.png)\n\nOne Page a Day Landing Page\n\nIn this article I'm going to go through how exactly the whole service works.\n\n## Landing Page (Free)\n\nI quickly coded a simple landing page and deployed it for free using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

Go on!\n\nThen you want to click on the create shared view option:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.27.34.png)\n\nNext click the share current view option:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.28.05.png)\n\nThen click the create embeddable link button (you think they would make this have less steps???):\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.28.39.png)\n\nAnd then click the embed in your site option:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.29.33.png)\n\nYou'll be taken to a [page like this](https://airtable.com/shrA5hwzrkPVye5pN/embed):\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.30.29.png)\n\nSet the options to use card layout and disallow filtering for now:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-21.31.10.png)\n\n## Displaying our Challenges\n\nThen **copy the embed code** and head back to the website to paste it into the code block:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.22.31.png)\n\nWhy are embeds always a premium option :(\n\nYou website now should look something like this:\n\n![](../static/posts/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)\n\nLooking Spicy \n\n## Adding Google Calendar Support\n\nHow do we add GCal support without writing any code? Links! Google calendar supports a certain format of URL which can automatically add events to a users calendar.\n\nLet's use this [free tool](https://jennamolby.com/tools/google-calendar-link-generator/) to see what the URL should look like:\n\n    http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE\u0026dates=20200501T010000Z%2F20200530T010000Z\u0026text=30%20Day%20Challenges\n    \n\nAs you can see from the above URL we need to add:\n\n1.  _action=TEMPLATE_ - This tells Gcal that this link is for making an event\n2.  _dates_ - This is how we set the dates for Gcal to add the event\n\nIn order to add this functionality to Airtable we're gonna have to write a formula. So let's first make a new field called \"Add to Calendar\":\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.33.43.png)\n\nFormulas allow us to manipulate values using functions that Airtable provides. I've put together a formula to generate the calendar links:\n\n    CONCATENATE('http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE\u0026dates=', DATETIME_FORMAT(NOW(), 'YYYYMMDD'), '%2F', DATETIME_FORMAT(DATEADD(NOW(), 30, 'day'), 'YYYYMMDD'), '\u0026text=', ENCODE_URL_COMPONENT(Title))\n    \n\nNow if we go back to our site we'll see that our entries have \"Add to Calendar\" links:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.47.35.png)\n\nWooHoo now you can click and add it to your calendar!\n\n## Adding Submissions\n\nIn order to add submissions we need to create an Airtable form. To do so create another table and call it \"Submissions\":\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.50.54.png)\n\n*   Email\n*   Title (single text)\n*   Description (long form text)\n*   Twitter Handle (single text)\n*   Challenge Difficulty (select with options 1 - 5)\n\nAdd the above five fields and then follow the steps we did earlier to embed a table but instead select the form view option:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.51.57.png)\n\nPlease select \"Create a form view\"\n\nYou'll be rewarded by seeing a form like this appear:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.53.58.png)\n\nAirtable is a lifesaver\n\nClick \"Share form\", copy the link and add it to your website:\n\n![](../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.56.02.png)\n\nAlmost like magic\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe've made it! We have a [running site](https://horse-vuvuzela-ph4p.squarespace.com/home) (password is 30days). As you can see we can view and add challenges to our calendar as well as submit challenges using the button in the top right corner.\n\nThe world is your oyster now. Go and create some kick ass sites. Here's a few of my node-code favourites:\n\n*   [https://roadtoscale.com/](https://roadtoscale.com/)\n*   [https://startupstash.com/](https://startupstash.com/)\n*   [https://budgetmealplanner.com/](https://budgetmealplanner.com/)","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2020-04-27T22:04:31.000Z","hero_image":"../static/posts/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-22.17.11-1.png","title":"Building a No-code 30 Day Challenge Website"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"building-a-no-code-30-day-challenge-website"},{"document":{"content":"\nOver the last few years I've collected a variety of tools to help cut down my wasted time. Here's a few tools that I found incredibly helpful:\n\n# Time Tracking\n\n**RescueTime**\n\nThere is probably a million time tracking apps at this point but one tool in particular which I kept getting recommended to me is [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/).\n\n![RescueTime](../static/posts/automation-rescuetime.png)\n\nRescueTime has a variety of great features that surpass many of the other tracking apps:\n\n* Cross Platform Apps: Chrome, Desktop, Mobile.\n* Daily, Weekly, Monthly summaries.\n* Huge categorisation database to aggregate from.\n* Set Goals for how you spend your time\n* Compare your time against people in the same industry as you\n\nI've used RescueTime to identify that I spent way too much time on Instagram and Reddit. Having cut those down my productivity hours has increased to fill those 2-3hrs I was wasting.\n\n**Google Calendar**\n\nOne of the most used calendar apps on this earth, Google Calendar is unbeatable when it comes to convenience and platforms. \n\nDid you know that you can also write scripts for Google Calendar? If you head to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/home) you can create/run/share scripts that are run on the Google Cloud.\n\nA way that I manage my time using GCal is to colour code my events. This gets repetitive if you're manually making events each day but [if you do a bit of programming magic](https://rickpastoor.com/2019/05/30/google-calendar-color-coder.html) you can have it colour code your week every 15 minutes:\n\n![Google Calendar](../static/posts/automation-gcal.png)\n\n\n## Task Management\n\nWhen it comes to Todo lists there are a few things I look for:\n\n1. Clean and simple interface\n2. Dates/Reminders to do different tasks\n3. Add descriptions / urls to the todos\n\nWith those criteria, I ended up stumbling across [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/home). [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/home) is an app which nails the Todo list experience and also helps me jot down every idea/task that I have throughout my day.\n\n[TickTick](https://ticktick.com/home) also packs in a load of other great features:\n\n* Cross Platform Support\n* Calendar View\n* Tagging\n* Habits\n* Streaks\n* Prioritising\n\n![TickTick](../static/posts/automation-ticktick.png)\n\n## Mail\n\nI'm not one of those people who suffer from ridiculous amounts of email a day (sometimes I wish I did). However when I do get an important email in the morning [I snooze it](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\u0026hl=en) until 2pm, this is because I like to keep my mornings focused and peaceful.\n\n[Gmail](https://gmail.com), a Google owned mail client allows me to do just that from any platform.\n\n_I'm not gonna put a picture here, you know what it looks like._\n\n## Food\n\n**Lifesum**\n\nIf you're into fitness like myself, calorie tracking is a must have for ensuring your body is getting the energy it needs to lose/gain weight.\n\nThere are two main apps which fight it out regularly for the best fitness app and those are [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) and [Lifesum](https://lifesum.com/).\n\nI'm a [Lifesum](https://lifesum.com/) fan mainly because of their friendly UI and diet plans that they have on the app 🥗. But feel free to try both and see which one works best for your routine:\n\n![Lifesum](../static/posts/automation-lifesum.jpg)\n\nPrice: £7 per month\n\n**Eat This Much**\n\nYou don't just need to track your calories to be healthy. You also need to eat the right kind of food in the right amounts.\n\nAdjusting recipes to fit those amounts is a chore, something I used to spend hours on each day. But thankfully [eatthismuch.com](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) has me covered.\n\n[Eat This Much](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) is a web tool that generates meal plans based on your diet preference and calories needed per day. It works amazingly well as it keeps the recipes it generates simple and easy to make.\n\nHere's an example of my Paleo meal plan:\n\n![Eat This Much](../static/posts/automation-eatthismuch.png)\n\n## Finance\n\nIf you haven't yet, read [I will teach you to be Rich](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/book/) by Ramit Sethi. This will teach you about Interest rates, Index Funds and automating your finances.\n\nWith that said, I use 3 apps to help me manage my finances:\n\n**Monzo**\n\nNot a day goes by where I don't want to move away from Monzo. Monzo for those outside the UK is challenger bank and is fully digital. You can open up sub accounts within your account to segment your money and manage direct debits etc straight from your phone.\n\nOne time saving killer feature is bill splitting. Simply tap on a transaction and choose your friends from your contacts and Monzo will split the bill evenly between you and your friends.\n\n![Monzo](../static/posts/automation-monzo.jpg)\n\n**Wealthsimple**\n\nIndex funds are a collection of the top performing stock in that current time. Index funds historically have risen for the last 100 years and are a great way to accumulate high interest on your money.\n\n[WealthSimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-gb/) is a service that auto-invests your money for you and reinvests any dividends back into that lump sum so it compounds over the years.\n\n![WealthSimple](../static/posts/automation-wealthsimple.png)\n\n**FreeTrade**\n\n[FreeTrade](https://freetrade.io/) is an app that let's you trade from your phone and doesn't charge commission on buying/selling stocks. You can invest your money into Index ETFs, Bond ETFs and individual stocks.\n\n![FreeTrade](../static/posts/automation-freetrade.png)\n\n## Cosmetics\n\n**Quip**\n\nHaving an electric toothbrush is paramount to a healthy dental hygiene. [Quip](https://www.getquip.com/) is a service that handles replacing your electric toothbrush head every 3 months by sending you a new head, battery and toothpaste.\n\nNot only does this save me time but it also helps me look forward to brushing my teeth as the brush itself is beautifully designed as well:\n\n![Quip](../static/posts/automation-quip.jpg)\n\nPrice: £7.65 every 3 months\n\n**Harry's**\n\nOn the same vein as Quip, [Harry's] (https://www.harrys.com/en/gb) is a Razor company that every 3 months sends me replacement heads for my Razor.\n\nWhat shocked me when I first tried Harry's is the quality of the Razor compared to my Gillette, it was noticeably sharper and the packaging even advised me to take it slower when I first used it.\n\n![Harry's](../static/posts/automation-harrys.jpg)\n\nPrice: £14 every 3 months\n\n**Asos**\n\nI hate retail. I hate going around all the shops trying on clothes. With [Asos](https://www.asos.com/) you can shop a variety of different brands and get sizing recommendations based off your height, weight and preferred fit.\n\n![Asos](../static/posts/automation-asos.png)\n\n## Flow\n\n**Headspace**\n\nIt's important to disconnect and refocus using meditation. [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) is the number one app for meditation and frankly it deserves it. It has lessons for each different thing you could want from NBA motivational meditations to sleep stories.\n\n![Headspace](../static/posts/automation-headspace.jpg)\n\nPrice: £10 per month\n\n**Tide.fm**\n\nNatural music helps me concentrate and achieve flow with my work. I prefer to use [Tide](https://tide.fm/en_US/) over [Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/) as Tide offers way more custom sounds like instrumentals and nature sounds. [Tide](https://tide.fm/en_US/) also let's you set a timer for how long you want to focus for.\n\n![Tide](../static/posts/automation-tide.jpg)","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2019-12-28T20:37:08.019Z","hero_image":"../static/posts/automation-cover.jpg","title":"Tools I use to automate my life"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"automation"},{"document":{"content":"\n[Outy](https://outy-app.herokuapp.com/) is an app I developed to help solve the problem of choosing places to meetup with friends.\n\nIt uses the [Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/) to fetch venues based on the geocode the user inputs in the search box. I designed the search functionality to be Google-esque in a way. So you can filter down by location by typing: `[category] in [place]` (e.g: Bakeries in Watford).\n\nThe app is powered using my favourite stack:\n\n* [Node / Express](https://expressjs.com/)\n* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)\n* [EJS](https://ejs.co)\n* [Cutestrap](https://www.cutestrap.com/)\n* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)\n\nIt may seem super boring but it's actually super productive to not have to setup React, Webpack etc to get an app out the door.

Kinda like Google Keep but a whole lot prettier.\n\nWhat drew me to their landing page in particular is their use of whitespace and clear copy to drive home what they're trying to achieve.\n\nTheir opening line, \"A Better Way to Organize \u0026 Refine Ideas\", let's the user know what the main purpose of this app is. Simply put they have made a better way to take and organise notes or designs.\n\nWhats also cool is that their subtitle goes through different use cases for the app: \"Working on a project, researching a topic or writing an article?\". This done to relate to the customers wants as most note taking app customers are using the tool in 1 of those 3 ways.\n\nLet's talk about CTAs, especially when you have 3 of them. It can be tempting to make each CTA of equal importance but this would spell confusion and add a lack of direction for the customer.\n\nInstead Walling has made the sign up form huge and prominent compared to the rest of the CTAs. Not looking to give up your email yet? Why not watch a video of how it works? Not interested in watching a video? Try a demo of our product! They covered each different type of interest level and kept it from being problematic by having each level reduce in size and colour.\n\n![Walling's Landing Page](../static/posts/walling-2.png)\n\nScrolling down reveals why we should use Walling. They have kept it rather brief in order to show off the true USP of the product which is it's User Interface, which you can see playing as a GIF in the right hand side.\n\nLet's go through each reason:\n\n1. \"Brain dump with ease\"\n   * Clear and simple. I know as a creative person myself that just vomiting information into a notes app is one of the most common use cases.\n   * They distinguish themselves from normal note apps by saying \"Unlike linear documents, with Walling you can throw out your ideas into Bricks\". This is a good example of pushing their USP to the customer.\n\n2. \"See the big picture\"\n   * Walling's USP is to have all your ideas present in one big screen like a real Pinboard. They push this across well: \"Walling empowers you to step back and get a high level understanding\".\n   * They're not done yet. Below this point you get links to examples of completed boards where you can see for yourself the \"big picture\".\n\n![Walling's Landing Page](../static/posts/walling-3.png)\n\nNow we're getting to the push for driving a sign up. Highly relevant quote from ProductHunt is situated above the form as a last ditch effort to entice customers to sign up.\n\nNotice how in the form they have again listed out every target customer in their byline: \"whether you are a designer, a developer, a project manager, a writer or even a non-tech.\". This is done to reach out and personalise their customer and reassure them that this product can be used in their role.\n\n![Walling's Landing Page](../static/posts/walling-4.png)\n\nLastly let's take a look at their FAQ section.\n\n1. \"How can I use Walling in my workflow?\"\n   * I'm not sure this is needed that much and probably the actual question Walling might be asked is: \"Do you offer an integration to my existing tools?\".\n2. \"What platforms does Walling support?\"\n   * Walling should have added download buttons as their CTAs instead of chasing emails. Not only do they get an app on their user's device which would increase engagement but also customer's know whether or not they can use Walling.\n   * Having to scroll all the way down to get this information is very helpful and feel somewhat deceitful.\n3. \"What are Walling's price plans?\"\n   * \"Walling gives you a 7 day free trial and then $4/mo for unlimited Bricks and Walls.\" - Wow this is amazing only $4/mo for this app ?!? If only they shouted about this more, having the sign up forms made it feel like the app wasn't ready yet, I bet for this price a lot of creatives would try this out.\n   * \"Workspaces for teams with centralized billing for $6/mo per team member.\" - Wait what? So $4 for a single user? And then $6 for a team member? Why not $4 per team member? Don't just increase pricing because its a company, when we can see you can clearly afford $4 per user!\n\n## Score: 6.5/10 - Minimal, Beautiful, Case study rich but lacks transparency","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2019-12-24T15:55:26.370Z","hero_image":"../static/posts/walling-1.png","title":"Rating Landing Pages: Walling"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"rating-landing-pages-walling"},{"document":{"content":"\nI wrote this article back in 2016 and a lot has changed since. Because of this shift I have decided to remove certain sections that are no longer considered best practises or are based on ES5 APIs. Enjoy :)\n\n## 1. Don’t use commas when declaring variables\n\nThe variables can now be easily moved around from line to line without having to worry about the commas.\n\n```javascript\nlet a = 2,\n  b = a + 2,\n  c = b - 3;\n\nlet a = 2;\nlet b = a + 2;\nlet c = b - 3;\n```\n\n## 2. Move code into separate modules\n\nBefore:\n\n```javascript\nclass Stock {\n  checkItemIsInStock(item) {\n    // logic\n  }\n}\n\nclass Basket {\n  constructor() {\n    this.stock = new Stock();\n    this.items = [];\n  }\n  addToBasket(item) {\n    if (this.stock.checkItemIsInStock(item)) {\n      this.items.push(item);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```javascript\nimport Stock from \"./stock\";\nimport Basket from \"./basket\";\n\nconst shoppingCart = new Basket(new Stock());\n```\n\n## 3. Utilize the Module pattern\n\nThe closure created by the [Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/mastering-the-module-pattern) allows privacy. E.g: The `privateMethod()` is only accessible by the inner `Basket` class:\n\n```javascript\nconst Basket = (() =\u003e {\n  // encapsulate a private function\n  const privateMethod = () =\u003e true;\n\n  class Basket {\n    publicMethod() {\n      privateMethod(); // use private methods\n    }\n  }\n\n  return Basket;\n})();\n```\n\n## 4. Comment your code\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Creates a Point to be used in D3\n * @class Point\n * @example\n * new Point(2, 3);\n */\nclass Point {\n  /**\n   * @constructor\n   * @param {number} x - The x value.\n   * @param {number} y - The y value.\n   * @returns {Point} new instance of Point\n   */\n  constructor(x, y) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis allows developers to get a deeper understanding of what is happening in your code without having to figure it out from the code. If you use [JSDOC](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html) the comments can be used to generate online documentation guides.\n\n## 5. Learn design patterns\n\n- [The Observer pattern](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/observer-design-pattern) helps your modules communicate to each other through events thus providing loose coupling in your app.\n\n- [The Mediator pattern](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/mediator-design-pattern) takes control over a group of objects by encapsulating how these objects interact. E.g: a basket that handles items.\n\n- [The Iterator pattern](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/iterator-design-pattern) is the underlying pattern for ES2015 generators.\n\n- [The Facade pattern](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/facade-design-pattern) provides an simple interface which encapsulates the end user from complex functionality. E.g: Email module with simple methods such as start, stop and pause;\n\nNot only are these solutions to commonly solved problems, they are a way of describing application structure to other developers fairly simply. E.g: _“The basket module is a mediator for all the store items, it communicates to the payment module via an observer”_.\n\n## 6. Pass objects into functions with a large number of arguments\n\n```javascript\n// not so good\nfunction colorWidget(\n  element,\n  colorValue,\n  colorRange,\n  colorFormat,\n  opacity,\n  onChange\n) {}\n\ncolorWidget($(\"\u003cdiv/\u003e\"), \"#fff\" /*...*/);\n\n// way better\nfunction colorWidget({\n  element = $(\"\u003cdiv/\u003e\"),\n  colorValue = \"#000\",\n  colorRange = [0, 255],\n  colorFormat = \"rgb\",\n  opacity = 0.8,\n  onChange = () =\u003e {}\n}) {\n  // ...\n}\ncolorWidget({\n  element: $(\"\u003cdiv/\u003e\")\n});\n```\n1. Simple to add new options\n2. The developer doesn’t have to worry about the order of the arguments\n3. Simple to add default values\n\n## 7. Don’t use type constructors unless specifically necessary\n\n```javascript\n// Before\nconst x1 = new Object();\nconst x2 = new String();\nconst x3 = new Number();\nconst x4 = new Boolean();\nconst x5 = new Array();\nconst x6 = new RegExp(\"()\");\nconst x7 = new Function();\n\n// After\nconst x1 = {};           \nconst x2 = \"\";           \nconst x3 = 0;            \nconst x4 = false;        \nconst x5 = [];           \nconst x6 = /()/;         \nconst x7 = function(){};\n```\n\nThe creation through type constructors is significantly slower than primitives. Also because the end result of the constructor is an `Object` rather than a primitive value you get [nasty side effects](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5750656/whats-the-point-of-new-stringx-in-javascript) like so:\n\n```javascript\nconst a = new String(\"x\");\na === \"x\"  //false\na == \"x\" //true\n\nconst b = \"dog\";\nb.woof = true;\nb.woof; // undefined\n\nconst c = new String(\"dog\");\nc.woof = true;\nc.woof; // true\n```\n\n## 8. Make sure your context is right\n\n```javascript\nclass Button {\n  constructor () {\n    this.count = 0;\n  }\n  click () {\n    this.count += 1;\n  }\n  init () {\n    $(\"button\").click(this.click);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom a glance this should work however when a user clicks the button we will get an error that count doesn’t exist. This is because the click function is executed in the context of the `$(\"button\")` element instead of the `Button` object. We can fix this by binding the context to the function:\n\n```javascript\nclass Button {\n  constructor () {\n    this.count = 0;\n  }\n  click () {\n    this.count += 1;\n  }\n  init () {\n    $(\"button\").click(() =\u003e this.click());\n    // or using bind\n    $(\"button\").click(this.click.bind(this));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 9. Apply\n\n\u003e The `apply()` method calls a function with a given this `value` and `arguments` provided as an array (or [an array-like object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#Working_with_array-like_objects)). — MDN\n\nSome useful instances of using apply:\n\n```javascript\n// emulating \"super\" in an constructor \nSomeConstructor.prototype.somemethod.apply(this, arguments);\n\n// passing an array of promises to jQuery.when\n$.when.apply($, [$.get(), $.get()]);\n\n// finding the max number in an array\nMath.max.apply(Math.max, [1,2,3,4,5]);\n```\n\n## Bonus Points\n\nContributed by: [Russley Shaw](https://medium.com/@russleyshaw)\n\n## 10. Use let and const over var\n\n`let` allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used.\n\nLets look at a few use cases where this is useful over `var` statements:\n\n```javascript\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll('p');\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c elements.length; i++) {                                 \n    // have to wrap in IIFE other i would be elements.length\n    (function(count){  \n       elements[count].addEventListener('click', function(){\n           elements[count + 1].remove();\n       });\n     })(i);\n}\n\n// using let\nlet elements = document.querySelectorAll('p');\nfor (let i = 0; i \u003c elements.length; i++) {\n   elements[i].addEventListener('click', function(){\n        elements[i + 1].remove();\n   });\n}\n```\n\nThe reason why the top example would be `elements.length` is because `i` is referenced directly so on the next iteration `i` is incremented. When we wrap the code in an IIFE we reference `i` under the parameter `count` thus removing the direct reference.\n\n`const` allows the declaration of variables that cannot be re referenced. This is useful for declaring constants (the keyword originates from it).\n\n```javascript\nconst API_KEY = '2rh8ruberigub38rt4tu4t4';\nconst PI = 3.14;\n```\n\nHowever objects and arrays can still be accessed and changed. To stop this use `Object.freeze()`:\n\n```javascript\nconst API_CONFIG = Object.freeze({\n  'key': '8ry4iuggi4g38430t5485jmub',\n  'endpoint': '/some/boring/api/path/'\n});\nAPI_CONFIG.key = null; // attempt to change\nAPI_CONFIG.key; //= '8ry4iuggi4g38430t5485jmub'\n\nconst EVENS = Object.freeze([ 2, 4, 6, 8]);\nEVENS[2] = 9;\nEVENS[2]; //= 6\n```\n\n## 11. Avoid using “or” when referencing variables\n\nThe only reason to avoid doing this is when the variable is allowed to be `false` . Take a look at the example below:\n\n```javascript\nlet msg = ''; //= should hide the button\nlet btnMsg = msg || 'Click Me';\n\nbtnMsg; //= 'Click Me'\n```\n\nThe reason this happens is due to the conversion of the `\"”` into a Boolean which returns false . As the `\"”` is counted as `false` the `or` comparison returns the other side `'Click Me'`.\n\nIf you want to have shorthand if statements you can use the ternary operator:\n\n```javascript\nvar msg = ''; //= should hide the button\nvar btnMsg = msg.length \u003c 5 ? msg : 'Click Me';\n\nbtnMsg; //= ''\n```","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2019-12-24T13:56:26.370Z","hero_image":"../static/js-cover.png","title":"9 ways to level up your JavaScript code"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"9-ways-to-level-up-your-javascript-code"},{"document":{"content":"\nI wrote this article back in 2016 and a lot has changed since.

Enjoy :)\n\nInterfaces are great for when you need to enforce some rules about how a developer builds a class. For example we have a Form class, this class is composed of lots of Fields/Inputs. Instead of writing logic to handle all different types of inputs we can define a common interface between them all.\n\nOur Interface will contain a `render()` method to render out the input and a `value()` method to get the input’s value.\n\n```javascript\nconst required = () =\u003e {\n  throw new Error(\"Implement!\");\n};\n\nclass InputInterface {\n  render = required;\n  value = required;\n}\n```\n\nWe can apply the Interface to a Base Input class so that all of our derived classes have the Interface.\n\n```javascript\nclass Input extends InputInterface {}\n```\n\nNow whenever you call `render()` you will get an Implementation Error. This forces the developer to override the Base class’s methods. Thus you have forced them to implement the interface.\n\n```javascript\nclass Checkbox extends Input {\n  constructor () {\n    this.$el = $(\"\u003cinput/\u003e\", { type: \"checkbox\" }); \n  }\n  render () {\n    return this.$el;\n  }\n  value () {\n    return this.$el.prop(\"checked\");\n  }\n}\n```","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2019-12-24T13:56:26.370Z","hero_image":"../static/js-cover.png","title":"Quick Guide to using interfaces with JavaScript"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"quick-guide-to-using-interfaces-with-javascript"},{"document":{"content":"\nI spend a lot of my time developing new reusable UI components.\n\nThis means during development I tend to extract UI components that are placed in a shared library or styleguide.\nThese components are reused throughout the entire project. Often having different styles or layouts when integrated into features.\n\nAlong the way I learnt a few rules that helped me save time and pain.\n\n## 1. Keep the layout fluid\n\nI can’t count the amount of times a component has had a fixed width and that has affected a responsive design. Meaning I have to go in and fiddle with the existing props that was set up in place for another feature somewhere in the site. Not good.\n\nBy keeping the component 100% width you pass the layout responsibility up to the parent component.\n\nFor example it’s a lot easier to use `CardOne` over `CardTwo`. As `CardOne` will respond to the parent's column changes when the screen size changes.\n\n```javascript\nconst CardOne = ({ title }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cdiv style={{ \n    padding: \"20px 30px\", \n    background: \"white\" \n  }}\u003e{title}\u003c/div\u003e\n);\n\nconst CardTwo = ({ title }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cdiv style={{ \n    width: 600, \n    padding: \"10px\",\n    background: \"white\" \n  }}\u003e\n    {title}\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n);\n\nconst App = () =\u003e (\n  \u003cdiv className=\"row\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"col-md-6\"\u003e\n      \u003cCardOne title=\"I'm Fluid\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"col-md-6\"\u003e\n      \u003cCardTwo title=\"I will break this layout\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n);\n```\n\n## 2. Allow extra props to be passed\n\nTurns out that your Button component needs a specific data attribute to work with the library you’re using for one of the specific features. Too bad that the `Button` component only allows `className`, `children` and `onClick`.\n\nHow can we fix this?\n\n[Modern ES6 JavaScript allows you to spread function parameters and objects.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) This can be used to feed props to components.\n\n```javascript\n// Before -\u003e \u003cbutton className=\"button\"\u003eClick me\u003c/button\u003e\n\nconst Button = ({ children, className, onClick }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cbutton \n    onClick={onClick} \n    className={`${styles.button} ${className || \"\"}`}\u003e\n    {children}\n  \u003c/button\u003e\n);\n\n// After -\u003e \u003cbutton className=\"button\" data-theme=\"dark\"\u003eClick me\u003c/button\u003e\n\nconst Button = ({ className, ...props }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cbutton \n    className={`${styles.button} ${className || \"\"}`} \n    {...props} /\u003e\n);\n\n// Example\n\nconst App = ({ onActivate }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cSpecificFeature\u003e\n    \u003cButton data-theme=\"dark\" onClick={onActivate}\u003e\n      Click me\n    \u003c/Button\u003e\n  \u003c/SpecificFeature\u003e\n);\n```\n\n## 3. Push logic upwards / Keep it dumb\n\nOne of the top things that prevents reusability is when stateful logic specific to a feature is implemented within a reusable component.\n\nImagine you have a `Dropdown` component. That you have used in your navigation when a link is clicked.\n\n```javascript\nconst DropdownItem = ({ className, ...props }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cli className={`dropdown-item ${className || \"\"}`} {...props} /\u003e\n);\n\nclass Dropdown extends React.Component {\n  state = { toggled: false };\n  toggle = () =\u003e this.setState(state =\u003e ({ toggled: !state.toggled }));\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \u003cdiv className=\"navbar-link\"\u003e\n        \u003cspan onClick={this.toggle}\u003e {this.props.title} \u003c/span\u003e\n        {this.state.toggled \u0026\u0026 (\n          \u003cul className=\"dropdown\"\u003e {this.props.children} \u003c/ul\u003e\n        )}\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst Navbar = () =\u003e (\n  \u003cdiv className=\"navbar\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"navbar-brand\"\u003eExample\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cul className=\"navbar-menu\"\u003e\n      \u003cDropdown title=\"My Account\"\u003e\n        \u003cDropdownItem\u003eOne\u003c/DropdownItem\u003e\n        \u003cDropdownItem\u003eTwo\u003c/DropdownItem\u003e\n      \u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n);\n```\n\nThe problem above is:\n\n1. `Dropdown` handles the logic for opening and closing the dropdown. Making it a lot harder to reuse `Dropdown` for more complicated scenarios (e.g: only open the dropdown when a request is successful).\n\n2. `Dropdown` has markup that relates to the `Navbar` component.\n\nIf we refactor the `Dropdown` component to push the logic up. We end up with a much more reusable `Dropdown` component.\n\n```javascript\nconst DropdownItem = ({ className, ...props }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cli className={`dropdown-item ${className || \"\"}`} {...props} /\u003e\n);\n\nconst Dropdown = ({ className, ...props }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cul className={`dropdown ${className || \"\"}`} {...props} /\u003e\n);\n\nclass Navbar extends React.Component {\n  state = { showUserOptions: false };\n  \n  toggleOptions = () =\u003e {\n    this.setState(state =\u003e ({\n      showUserOptions: !state.showUserOptions\n    }));\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \u003cdiv className=\"navbar\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv className=\"navbar-brand\"\u003eExample\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cul className=\"navbar-menu\"\u003e\n          \u003cdiv className=\"navbar-link\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan onClick={this.toggleOptions}\u003eMy Account\u003c/span\u003e\n            {this.state.showUserOptions \u0026\u0026 (\n              \u003cDropdown\u003e\n                \u003cDropdownItem\u003eOne\u003c/DropdownItem\u003e\n                \u003cDropdownItem\u003eTwo\u003c/DropdownItem\u003e\n              \u003c/Dropdown\u003e\n            )}\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Summary\n* Keep the component layout fluid.\n* Allows extra props to be passed into the component.\n* Keep logic out of them as much as possible.","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2019-12-24T13:56:26.370Z","hero_image":"../static/js-cover.png","title":"The rules of reusable components"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"the-rules-of-reusable-components"},{"document":{"content":"\nSeparating logic from your presentation has always been a best practise. It enforces the [single responsibility principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and makes the code easier to test.\n\nReact however gets in trouble for letting developers mush the two concerns together with ease. Lets take an example from the [homepage](https://reactjs.org/) to explain:\n\n```javascript\nclass Timer extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { seconds: 0 };\n  }\n  tick() {\n    this.setState(prevState =\u003e ({ seconds: prevState.seconds + 1 }));\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.interval = setInterval(() =\u003e this.tick(), 1000);\n  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    clearInterval(this.interval);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return \u003cdiv\u003eSeconds: {this.state.seconds}\u003c/div\u003e;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAbove you can see the rather simple Timer class. You can also see the display logic for the class is coded right into the `render()` method.\n\nThe problem with having `\u003cdiv\u003eSeconds: {this.state.seconds}\u003c/div\u003e` in the `Timer` class is that it’s not separating logic from presentation.\n\nLets separate the two concerns:\n\n```javascript\nconst SecondsActive = ({ seconds }) =\u003e \u003cdiv\u003eSeconds: {seconds}\u003c/div\u003e;\n\nclass TimerContainer extends React.Component {\n  state = { seconds: 0 };\n  tick() {\n    this.setState(({ seconds }) =\u003e ({ seconds: seconds + 1 }));\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.interval = setInterval(() =\u003e this.tick(), 1000);\n  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    clearInterval(this.interval);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return this.props.view({ seconds: this.state.seconds });\n  }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  \u003cTimerContainer view={SecondsActive} /\u003e,\n  document.getElementById(\"app\")\n);\n```\n\nWith a simple switch to rendering via a prop we have made the `Timer` class reusable across many presentational components and have made the presentational component super easy to test!","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2019-12-24T13:56:26.370Z","hero_image":"../static/js-cover.png","title":"Utilise render props in React"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"utilise-render-props-to-separate-logic-from-presentation-in-react"},{"document":{"content":"\n\u003e Don’t reinvent the wheel, just realign it. — Anthony J.

Enjoy :)_\n\n\n## It is the small things that count\n\nSmall problems are usually overlooked by the developer, I myself have rushed and wrote sloppy functions as I had lack of care for the smaller problem.\n\nAn example of rushing:\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(() =\u003e {\n  const heading = $(\"h1\").text();\n  const capital = heading[0].toUpperCase() + heading.slice(1);\n  $(\"h1\").text(capital);\n});\n```\n\nHow can we improve this? Right away we can pull out the entire function so it is no longer an anonymous function which allows us to reuse this block of code:\n\n```javascript\nconst capitalizeHeading = () =\u003e {\n  const heading = $(\"h1\").text();\n  const capital = heading[0].toUpperCase() + heading.slice(1);\n  $(\"h1\").text(capital);\n};\n\n$(\"button\").click(capitalizeHeading);\n```\n\nLets make this even more useful and extract the capitalizing logic:\n\n```javascript\nconst capitalize = (word = \"\") =\u003e word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);\n\nconst capitalizeHeading = () =\u003e {\n  const heading = $(\"h1\").text();\n  $(\"h1\").text(capitalize(heading));\n};\n\n$(\"button\").click(capitalizeHeading);\n```\n\nNow we can reuse the capitalizing logic across our program.\n\nDid you know that [jQuery constructs a new Object and queries the DOM every time you call `$(\u003cselector\u003e)`?](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L34). We should cache jQuery objects in order to speed up execution times:\n\n```javascript\nconst capitalize = (word = \"\") =\u003e word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);\n\nconst capitalizeHeading = () =\u003e {\n  const $h1 = $(\"h1\"); // cache h1 in a variable\n  $h1.text(capitalize($h1.text())); // reuse without creating\n};\n\n$(\"button\").click(capitalizeHeading);\n```\n\n`capitalizeHeading()` is okay for this one use case but it would be much more useful if it accepted a parameter to indicate what elements to capitalize:\n\n```javascript\nconst capitalize = (word = \"\") =\u003e word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);\n\nconst capitalizeElement = element =\u003e () =\u003e\n  element.text(capitalize(element.text()));\n\n$(\"button\").click(capitalizeElement($(\"h1\")));\n```\n\nWe can also wrap the execution in another function in order to create a partial. This is a function which has its arguments preloaded before execution, in this case we have made the element parameter a `$(“h1”)`.\n\nTurning `capitalizeHeading` into `capitalizeElement(\u003celement\u003e)` allows us to reuse that function for any element we wish to capitalize:\n\n```javascript\ncapitalizeElement($(\"h2\"));\ncapitalizeElement($(\"div[data-title]\"));\n```\n","data":{"author":"Kameron Tanseli","date":"2019-12-24T13:56:26.370Z","hero_image":"../static/js-cover.png","title":"Writing reusable JavaScript (Revised)"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"slug":"writing-reusable-javascript"}],"post":{"content":"\n[Outy](https://outy-app.herokuapp.com/) is an app I developed to help solve the problem of choosing places to meetup with friends.\n\nIt uses the [Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/) to fetch venues based on the geocode the user inputs in the search box.
